    /// The SAFE "fewer trips" fix for automatic crafting bills. Vanilla DoBill hand-carries ingredients one stack
    /// per round-trip; the earlier attempt to re-drive the whole craft under a custom job def was retired because
    /// vanilla only records placed ingredients (<c>job.placedThings</c>) for its own <c>JobDefOf.DoBill</c> — a
    /// custom-def craft could finish without consuming ingredients (duplication). This driver therefore does the
    /// ONE thing vanilla can't — the gathering — and lets vanilla do 100% of the crafting:
    ///
    ///   1. GATHER: walk the bill's chosen floor ingredient stacks and load them ALL into inventory in one sweep
    ///      (overweight by default — the player opted into the slowdown; strict-carry-weight honours the ceiling),
    ///      TAGGING each loaded stack in <see cref="CompHauledToInventory"/>.
    ///   2. Walk to the bench and END.
    ///   3. The pawn's next work scan re-issues the SAME bill; the ingredient chooser (via the existing
    ///      shared-inventory bill patch, F3c) now sees the pawn's tagged carried stock — and since the chooser sorts
    ///      candidates by <c>PositionHeld</c> distance to the bench and the pawn is STANDING at the bench, the
    ///      carried stacks rank first (decompile-verified comparator). Vanilla's own DoBill then pulls them from
    ///      inventory (its collection natively supports carried things), records placedThings correctly, and crafts.
    ///
    /// Item safety by construction: this job only MOVES things (TakeToInventory = SplitOff+TryAdd) and tags them, so
    /// the unload pass reclaims anything left over if the craft never happens (bill deleted, pawn interrupted). It
    /// never touches the recipe flow, so duplication is impossible. If nothing could be loaded, a short per-pawn
    /// cooldown stops the conversion from re-issuing (the bill then runs vanilla multi-trip — fail-open).
