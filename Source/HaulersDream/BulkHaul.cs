        //    CompDeepStorage.MaxNumberStacks (prefix) and ASF's per-cell limit (transpile) all funnel through.

        //    count clamp; SatisfiedStorage's fill-line has no count clamp at all; LWM mass-limited shelves are
        //    mass-blind here. This is a SAFE UPPER BOUND, never an under-estimate, and it self-corrects with no
        //    strand: the deposit re-gate (JobDriver_UnloadHauledInventory.FindTargetOrDrop re-runs the same
