    /// The two branches are INDEPENDENTLY gated (transporters → <c>WorkGiver_LoadTransporters</c>; portals →
    /// <c>WorkGiver_HaulToPortal</c>) so enabling one while disabling the other leaves the still-vanilla option intact.

    /// slice, partly) pawns/corpses, HD's planner returns no job — so suppressing the vanilla option would leave a
    /// DEAD END (no way to load those bodies at all). Therefore each branch suppresses ONLY when
    /// <see cref="TransportLoad.TryGiveBulkJob"/> would return a non-null job for THIS pawn+target; when it would not,
    /// the vanilla carry option survives so the player can still hand-load the pawns/corpses one at a time.

    /// The probe is the SAME call (with the same <c>playerOrder: true</c> eligibility path) HD's float-menu provider

    /// refreshes the ledger's manifest view (idempotent, the same <c>LoadRegisterOrUpdate</c> the work-scan/menu does)
    /// and reads available-to-claim, but records NO claim and NO reservation (the driver claims in its
    /// <c>Notify_Starting</c>, never the builder). So building-but-discarding the probed job reserves no quota.
    ///
    /// Vehicles are NOT handled here: Vehicle Framework loads cargo via a Hauling work-scan, not a vanilla
    /// float-menu option, so there is no vanilla load option to suppress for vehicles (the autonomous scan is
