# haulers-dream

## 1.22.0

### Minor Changes

- 5ca40c7: Add a per-bench "Gather ingredients" button, so you can switch off ingredient gathering at one particular workbench and let RimWorld's own behaviour run there instead (#230). Select a bench and the button sits on its command bar, exactly like Common Sense's per-bench cleaning toggle. It is on for every bench by default, so nothing changes until you press it, and a bench you switch off stays off across saves. Selecting several benches at once shows one button for all of them; clicking it flips every bench that is currently in the state the button is showing, so a selection where they all agree flips together, and a mixed selection takes a second click to catch the rest.

  This is for the bench you keep stocked from right next door. Hauler's Dream normally has a colonist sweep every ingredient a bill needs into their pack in one go, then walk to the bench once — a clear win when the materials are scattered across the base, and a loss when they are already sitting beside the stove. The reason it can be a loss is not the pick-up itself: the sweep grabs each stack instantly, and deliberately skips the short pause the mod applies elsewhere. The cost is that the sweep is a _separate job_ that ends at the bench. The colonist walks back, finishes that job, and only picks the bill up again on their next look for work — so where the sweep saves you nothing, that extra step is pure delay. Switching the bench off puts back RimWorld's own flow there: one stack carried straight to the bench, and the bill starts immediately.

  Switching a bench off also stops Hauler's Dream's other ingredient detour there: the one where a colonist first moves a bill's ingredients to a stockpile nearer the bench, then fetches them from the new spot. That is the same shape of cost — a job that ends somewhere other than the bench, with the bill waiting for the next look for work — so a bench you have asked to behave like vanilla no longer does it either.

  One change lands whether or not you ever press the button: self-running Biotech benches — the mech gestator and the subcore encoder — no longer get that move-the-ingredients-closer detour at all. They have never been part of the one-sweep gather, and they have no colonist standing at them waiting on a bill, so this simply makes all three of Hauler's Dream's ingredient paths agree about which benches they apply to. There is no button on those benches, because there is nothing left there to switch off.

  Switching a bench off also stops batch crafting at that bench — bills set to Batch there craft one at a time — and the batch options disappear from the repeat-mode dropdown while it is off, so the mod never offers a mode it will not actually run. This is deliberate rather than incidental: both the one-sweep gather and batch crafting collect ingredients the same way, and batch crafting does so regardless of the global "Carry crafting ingredients in inventory" setting. Switching a bench off therefore wins over the settings on the Build and Craft tab, and keeps working even with that global setting turned off — which is exactly when batching is the only thing still gathering.

  Worth knowing which bills this actually reaches on a cooking stove. The plain one-sweep gather has always skipped recipes that mix ingredients freely, and every vanilla meal recipe does — simple and bulk meals, fine, lavish and survival meals, pemmican, kibble, beer and baby food. So on a stove the gather that a bench switch turns off is batch crafting, or a recipe that does not mix. If your stove crawls on ordinary one-at-a-time meal bills, this switch is not the cause and will not change it; please open a report with your log so it can be looked at properly.

  There is a new "Show the per-bench 'Gather ingredients' button" setting on the Build and Craft tab under Crafting, on by default, if you would rather keep the command bar clear. It only controls whether the button is drawn: a bench you have already switched off stays switched off either way, so hiding the control can never quietly turn gathering back on somewhere you turned it off.

- 5ca40c7: Batch crafting can now be set by typing a number, not only by dragging a slider (#237). A small box sits beside the slider in all four places where a batch is sized: "Batch size" and "Batch overshoot" on a bill's repeat-mode dropdown, and the repetitions and timeout in the "Plan prioritized crafting" dialog. Both controls edit the same value, so drag when a rough figure will do and type when you want exactly 37. Hovering the box tells you what it accepts. The dialogs are the same size as before — the box is carved out of the right-hand end of the slider's own row rather than added below it.

  The box is deliberate about not fighting you while you type. Clearing it does not write a zero; it simply keeps the value you had until you type a new one. A number outside the allowed range is pulled back to the nearest end, and a timeout is rounded to the nearest half hour, but only once you click away or confirm — so if you type 3.7 hours you see 3.7 while typing and watch it settle to 3.5, rather than having a keystroke corrected out from under you. Both decimal separators work, so 3,5 and 3.5 mean the same thing.

  The repetitions box is the one exception to being held inside the slider's range: the slider stops at what your ingredients support right now, and the box lets you ask for more. That is on purpose. The game keeps running while the planning dialog is open, so the moment it counted your ingredients is already out of date — and asking for too many was never a problem, because the batch is trimmed to what is actually possible and the summary underneath tells you which limit did the trimming.

  One behaviour change worth knowing about: in the "Plan prioritized crafting" dialog, pressing Enter now means **Prioritize**. Previously Enter closed the dialog without ordering anything, which was a silent cancel — easy to mistake for a confirmation, and worse now that there is a box to type into. Escape still cancels. Where the plan cannot be run — including when the bench has no batchable bills at all — Enter now does nothing rather than closing the window, so it can no longer look like it accepted something it did not; use Escape or the X to leave. The two smaller batch pop-ups are unchanged: they have no confirm button because closing them _is_ the confirmation, so Enter, clicking away and the X all keep your number exactly as they always did.

- 5ca40c7: Corpse hauls now sweep and batch like every other haul, with a new setting to turn it off. Two Steam reports described the same gap from opposite sides: ordering a haul on a meal picked up a nearby item on the way, while ordering a haul on a corpse picked up the corpse and nothing else; and colonists and mechs were "hauling only single corpse at once".

  The cause is that RimWorld runs corpse hauling through a job of its own, separate from everything else it hauls, and Hauler's Dream had only ever hooked the other one. That made bodies invisible to bulk hauling from both directions at once: a haul anchored on a corpse never looked around it, and a corpse lying next to some other haul was never picked up in passing.

  Both halves are fixed. A haul on a corpse now sweeps the loose loot around the body into the hauler's pack on the same trip, and a body lying beside another haul rides along with it. What actually comes along is still decided by carry weight, so this is not a change to how much a colonist can carry. A humanlike corpse is around 60 kg against a typical ceiling near 96 kg, so bodies mostly still travel one at a time, and that part was always working as intended. The gain is in small game: a hare is about 24 kg and a squirrel about 12, so a hunter's catch comes home several at a time instead of one trip per animal.

  Auto-stripping is unchanged. Every corpse a pawn takes is still stripped exactly as one carried in its hands is.

  There is a new "Corpse hauls sweep and batch like any other haul" checkbox on the Hauling tab under Bulk hauling, on by default, if you would rather bodies kept RimWorld's own one-per-trip behaviour.

  Two limits are worth knowing about. A bulk haul needs the thing it is anchored on to fit in the hauler's pack, so a corpse heavier than the colonist's remaining carry ceiling — a muffalo, or a human body for a colonist who is already loaded — declines the bulk job and falls back to RimWorld's ordinary hand-carry, which sweeps nothing. The reported case, a human corpse next to a meal with an unloaded colonist, does work. Separately, if you have set auto-stripping to "on disposal hauls only", a body that gets swept into a pack and later buried now arrives at the grave still dressed, because at pick-up time there is no way to know where it will end up. Nothing is destroyed and the gear is buried with the body, recoverable by exhuming it, and the default "on every corpse haul" mode is not affected.

  Right-clicking a corpse and choosing "Haul everything nearby" already worked before this change; that order has always been able to anchor on a body. What is new there is that it can now sweep up other bodies too.

- 5ca40c7: Colonists in withdrawal can now reach a drug another colonist is keeping in their pack (#229). Every RimWorld drug search only looks at drugs lying on the map or carried by colony animals, so a drug in a colonist's pack is invisible to an addict — and telling a colonist to keep one there used to hide it for good, since Hauler's Dream also stops RimWorld from making them put it down. RimWorld never allows that on its own: it makes a colonist drop any drug they have no reason to carry. Now, when a colonist craves or is withdrawing from a drug they're addicted to and there is none to be found on the map, they walk over to the colleague holding some and take a single dose, then come back for the next one if they need it. Only drugs Hauler's Dream itself is holding in place can be reached this way — a "Keep in inventory" pin, or a load being hauled to storage. Drugs a colonist carries for their own drug policy are still untouchable, exactly as in RimWorld, so nothing about normal drug supply changes. Nobody ever takes from a drafted, downed, dead or mentally broken colonist, from a caravan that is forming, or out of a vehicle's cargo, and the drug policy is still the way to cut someone off: set the drug to not allowed "for addiction" and they remain fully blocked. There is a new "Let a colonist in withdrawal take a kept drug from another colonist" toggle under Build &amp; Craft → Food, on by default.

### Patch Changes

- 5ca40c7: Fix several haulers each carrying a full stack to a nearly-full stockpile, dropping the two or three that fit and carrying the rest back (#114). When a high-priority stockpile had been partly emptied and the same goods sat in a lower-priority one, every free colonist would set off with a whole stack for the handful of slots that had opened up. The better stockpile filled a trickle at a time while a dozen round trips were burned on it. An earlier fix taught each pawn to take only what fit, but it fell short in two ways, and both are addressed now. It measured a stockpile's free space by walking its cells, and gave up on anything larger than 200 cells — a 15 by 15 stockpile is 225, so in a decent-sized base the limit was never applied at all. That walk is now bounded rather than abandoned: it looks at as much of a large stockpile as it can afford and works with what it found, which can under-state the room but never over-state it, so a pawn errs towards taking less rather than more. The other gap was that pawns could not see each other. Nothing has landed while several of them are being given work, so the stockpile honestly still looks empty to each one in turn. A pawn now also counts what its colleagues are already carrying, have already committed to fetch, or are hauling by hand towards that same storage, and only claims what is genuinely left over. A pawn with nothing left to claim simply does not convert the job — RimWorld's own hauling still runs it, already limited to what fits, so the work still gets done and no item is ever left behind or lost. This is a live estimate rather than a hard booking, deliberately: a reservation on storage space would let one interrupted pawn block a stockpile for everyone else. The trade is that a pawn given work in the same instant as another can still occasionally make one extra trip, instead of all of them making one every time.
- 5ca40c7: Fix one hauler making ten trips to load an exit where two would have done, carrying less on every trip (#167). With a single mech able to do the hauling and 33 items to move, it brought nine, then eight, then five, four, three, and finally single items in an otherwise empty pack, while the pile it was working through barely shrank. This one was ours. An earlier fix taught pawns to divide a big load between everyone who was going to help with it, which is right when a shuttle crew is loading together, but the count of "everyone" was far too generous: it included pawns that were never going to carry anything, most plainly mechs that cannot haul at all. A constructoid and a cleansweeper standing nearby each counted as a helper, so the one mech that could actually haul was given a third of the load for its first trip, a third of what was left for the next, and so on down to one item at a time.

  Two things changed. Only pawns genuinely committed to that load are counted now — the ones whose whole task is to fill this shuttle or portal and then board it — and each of them has to be someone the game would actually give a hauling job to, so a mech that cannot haul no longer takes a share it will never carry. And when everything still waiting fits in a single trip, it is not divided at all. Sharing a load out can only ever make a trip smaller, so splitting something one pawn could carry in one go was never anything but extra walking, and it is what produced the last few trips with almost nothing in the pack. A crew all loading the same shuttle still divides a large order between themselves exactly as it did before, and pods, portals and vehicles all behave the same way.

  One correction while we are here: the release notes for that earlier fix explained a "carries less and less each trip" report as leftover cargo from an interrupted load being counted against a pawn's carry limit forever. That was a real bug and it is still fixed, but it was not what was happening in this report, and it is worth saying so in case the explanation sent anyone looking in the wrong place.

- 5ca40c7: Fix "Add screenshots…" showing an empty grid for screenshots you had only just taken, leaving you nothing to attach to a report (#167). You press the screenshot key, RimWorld confirms it with "screenshot saved as…", you open the report window — and there is nothing there. The player who raised this had rebound keys that clashed with Steam's overlay, so every shot they took went missing from the one place they needed it.

  The cause is that a RimWorld screenshot has two possible homes, and Hauler's Dream only knew about one of them. The game hands a capture to Steam only while the Steam overlay is actually switched on; with the overlay off, unavailable, its hotkey taken by something else, or the game not running through Steam at all, RimWorld writes the picture into its own Screenshots folder beside your saves instead. The picker only ever looked in Steam's folder, so exactly the players who could not use the overlay were the ones it could not help. Both places are now read and merged into one list, newest first, so it no longer matters which route your screenshot took. The message shown when there is genuinely nothing to pick has been rewritten to match — it used to talk only about the Steam overlay.

  Attaching a picture the game did not take is possible now too, without RimWorld having gained a file browser. A new "Open screenshots folder" button opens RimWorld's own screenshots folder in your file manager, creating it first if you have never taken a screenshot outside Steam, so it always leads somewhere; hovering it shows the full path, which is your way in if your system ignores the request. Drop any PNG or JPG in there and it joins the list when you press the new Refresh button beside it. Refresh is a button on purpose rather than something that happens by itself when you switch back to the game: a list that re-read itself at that exact moment could catch a large file part-way through copying and remember it as broken.

  One change you will only notice as an absence. RimWorld's own screenshots are full-resolution PNGs — several megabytes on disk and a good deal larger once unpacked for display — where Steam supplies a small ready-made preview alongside each shot. Every preview is now shrunk to roughly the size of the tile it is shown in before being kept, and the full-size image is released immediately, so scrolling the whole grid costs a few megabytes rather than hundreds. The image actually uploaded with your report is still the untouched original.

- 5ca40c7: Fix "Auto-open Gear tab for selected carriers" opening the Gear tab for colonists instead of carriers, and re-opening it every time you click (#224). The setting is off by default, but with it on (including via an imported settings profile) it fired for any pawn holding anything Hauler's Dream had picked up, which in practice meant your colonists and almost never your pack animals: the internal mark that drove it stays with the hauler that gathered the load, not with the animal it was loaded onto, so the one case the setting advertised was the one case it never covered. It now does what it says, and only that: selecting one of your pack animals, vehicles or other non-human carriers that is carrying something opens its Gear tab, and colonists are left alone. RimWorld already keeps your last-opened tab open as you click between pawns, so nothing is lost there. Vehicle Framework vehicles are included: selecting a loaded vehicle opens its Cargo tab, since vehicles do not have a Gear tab at all.

  Both auto-open settings (carrier Gear and transporter Contents) now also fire only when the selection actually changes. Closing the tab and clicking the same animal or pod again no longer forces it back open, and re-clicking something you already have selected no longer yanks you out of the Work or Research tab with a tab-open sound. Clicking away and selecting it again still opens it. Both settings have moved out of "Advanced loading" into their own "Automatic tab opening" section in Bulk loading, and their descriptions now spell out exactly who they apply to.

- 5ca40c7: Fix Hauler's Dream's right-click orders letting pawns who cannot haul do hauling work anyway (#229). The check only looked at the "hauling" work tag, which an "incapable of dumb labor" backstory never sets even though it does disable the Hauling work type — so exactly the pawns RimWorld greys "Prioritize hauling" out for were still offered "Haul everything nearby", "Pick up", "Haul materials to…", the bulk load orders for transporters, portals and vehicles, "Load until complete", bulk refuelling, and bulk unloading a pack animal. All of those now apply the same bar RimWorld does, matching what Hauler's Dream already did for automatic hauling; the pawn simply isn't offered the order. If you want those pawns hauling regardless, the existing "Let pawns incapable of hauling pick up and haul anyway" setting now covers the right-click orders too, not just automatic pick-up — and so does "Let any pawn do these jobs". If you just want such a pawn to carry something without it becoming hauling work, "Keep X in inventory" is unchanged from before this fix and is still offered to the pawns above, drafted or not — it pins an item in the pack rather than queueing it for delivery, so it is not hauling work and deliberately does not get the new bar. Nor is ordering a pawn to load a pack animal on a caravan map, which RimWorld itself allows any pawn to do, or the per-pawn "Unload inventory" button, which always stays available so nothing a pawn is already carrying can ever be stranded. The automatic safety net that drops collected goods for a pawn who genuinely cannot deliver them was reading the same wrong check, and so never fired for these pawns; it now does.
- 5ca40c7: Fix pawns carrying items far outside the Home area and dropping them there when storage is full (#231). When no stockpile could take a load, Hauler's Dream fell back to a RimWorld routine whose last resort deliberately picks a random outdoor spot at the edge of the map, with no Home-area check — and because Hauler's Dream makes that decision for every collected stack rather than in the rare situations vanilla uses it, pawns re-rolled a new random spot for each item and scattered goods all over the map. Now a pawn with nowhere to store something puts it down on a good floor tile inside the Home area, close by rather than across the map, and repeated drops pile onto the same spot instead of spreading out. Nothing is lost: if there is genuinely no room in the Home area, the item is set down where the pawn stands, exactly as it would be without the mod, and it is picked up again automatically once storage frees up. The one place a load still stays in the pack is a caravan camp or other temporary map, on purpose — anything put down there is abandoned when the caravan moves on, so carrying it is the safer of the two. The "Cannot unload inventory" alert now says what actually happens instead of claiming the items stay in the pack. Hauler's Dream also records every one of these drops in its debug trail, so a bug report can show exactly where a load went.
- 5ca40c7: Fix right-clicking a colonist onto certain modded drugs producing the error "Value does not fall within the expected range." and no "Pick up" options at all (#232). The error is RimWorld's own, and it comes from its drug policy: when a colonist's policy has no entry for a particular drug, the lookup that asks "is this one scheduled?" raises that error instead of answering — and it raises it with no message attached, which is why the text names no drug, no colonist and no mod. That lookup runs before any Hauler's Dream code on this path.

  Hauler's Dream appeared in the report for two reasons, neither of which is evidence. RimWorld's patching library lists every mod that has hooked a method whenever anything goes wrong inside it, whether or not that mod's code ran — and here it had not run, because a hook of that kind is skipped entirely when the original fails. On top of that, the previous release had a fault of its own that rewrote where errors appeared to come from, pinning them on whatever Hauler's Dream happened to have hooked; that is fixed in this same release.

  What happens now: when that lookup fails, Hauler's Dream answers "keep this drug in the pack", which is RimWorld's own default answer for that question, so the menu builds normally and nothing gets dropped. It writes the error to the log once for each drug it happens to, naming the drug, so a report can actually identify it. It does not repair the drug policy — not by adding the missing entry, not by rebuilding it, not by swapping the policy out. Drug policies are saved data shared across your colony, and one of the two places this check runs from is the menu you are clicking, so quietly rewriting them there would change your save behind your back and would break multiplayer. Fixing another mod's or RimWorld's own saved data is not something a hauling mod should be doing.

  This matters well beyond the menu. The same check is what RimWorld uses, constantly, to decide whether a colonist should put a drug down: it runs for every drug in the pack of every undrafted colonist standing in your home area, on every attempt. An error there threw away that colonist's whole "put down what I do not need" routine, silently, every single time — no alert, nothing in the log to connect it to. That half was invisible and is now contained too. The error itself still occurs; Hauler's Dream stops it costing you anything.

  One more thing came out of the same investigation: the new feature that lets a colonist in withdrawal take a kept drug from a colleague was asking RimWorld the same question in the same unsafe way, on drugs found in other colonists' packs. It now uses the safe lookup — and it will not send a colonist after a drug RimWorld itself cannot evaluate. That matters, because taking a dose puts it in the addict's own pack, and RimWorld checks it again there on the next attempt; sending them after such a drug would leave them holding a dose they can never take and can never put down. So in that case the feature simply stands down and the colonist behaves exactly as they would without this mod installed.

- 5ca40c7: Fix clothing that Hauler's Dream collected staying in a colonist's pack forever when running Compositable Loadouts (#233). Hauler's Dream protects whatever a loadout mod wants a colonist to carry, so it never ships an item off to storage only for the other mod to send the colonist straight back out to fetch it again. It was applying that protection to clothing as well — but Compositable Loadouts never puts clothing in a pack. When a colonist is short a duster it sends them to _wear_ one off the floor, so there was nothing to protect and nothing that would ever have been fetched back. The result was that a loadout listing a duster made every spare duster Hauler's Dream had picked up sit in the pack permanently, because Hauler's Dream had put them there and Hauler's Dream was the only thing that would ever have taken them out. Clothing a colonist is hauling now goes to storage like anything else.

  The same protection now also notices a weapon the colonist is already holding. A loadout asking for one longsword is satisfied by the longsword in their hands, so a spare one they picked up while hauling is put away instead of being kept as if the loadout still needed it.

  Everything Compositable Loadouts genuinely does keep — the items it really does re-fetch — is still protected exactly as before, and nothing changes for anyone not running it.

- 5ca40c7: Fix pawns pocketing stripped gear that no stockpile will take, then dumping it wherever they end up (#234). Hauler's Dream only picks something up when it has somewhere to put it, and every kind of pick-up followed that rule except one: the automatic strip when a colonist hauls a corpse. That one took everything off the body regardless, so with "allow tainted apparel" unchecked in your stockpiles a pawn would pocket the dead raider's clothes, carry them to the butcher table it was fetching the corpse for, and leave them on the workshop floor. Now each stripped piece is only picked up if a stockpile would actually accept it. The strip still happens exactly as before, and everything that does have a home still rides along on the same trip — the rifle and the drugs come with the pawn even when the tainted shirt does not. A piece with nowhere to go is simply left lying at the body, not forbidden, exactly where a Strip order you placed by hand would have left it, and it is picked up automatically the moment a stockpile accepts it. Nothing is lost or destroyed. If you would rather tainted clothes never piled up at all, the "Tainted apparel" settings can leave them on the corpse, drop and forbid them, or destroy them outright.
- 5ca40c7: Fix a colony where every colonist wanders idle — nobody tends wounds, nobody hauls, nobody cleans — yet everyone still eats and sleeps normally, and forcing a job by right-clicking still works (#235). Mining a vein by force produced no steel because the ore was never hauled. The cause is in Smarter Construction, which crashes while deciding whether finishing a wall frame would seal someone in, but the damage was avoidable and is not: RimWorld protects the part of work selection that _looks_ for a job, and leaves the part that _turns the found target into a job_ completely unprotected. A crash there throws away the pawn's entire work decision, and RimWorld quietly skips work altogether on every following attempt. Eating and sleeping are decided separately, so they carried on, and a forced order takes a different route entirely — which is why it looked like laziness rather than an error.

  Hauler's Dream was already watching that spot, so it now does three things. It catches the crash, so at worst a colonist finds no work for that one moment instead of losing work permanently. If the same kind of work keeps crashing, it switches off just that one kind and leaves everything else running. And it tells you: an alert appears naming what was switched off and, whenever it can work it out, which mod caused it — so a job silently never happening again cannot go unnoticed. That work stops happening on its own until the mod responsible is updated or removed — with Smarter Construction, wall frames will not be finished by themselves meanwhile — but you keep a way out: right-clicking to prioritise it still issues a single job, because RimWorld builds that order directly and never asks the question Hauler's Dream switched off. The colonist just will not carry on with that work afterwards. The alert says so. The list clears when you restart the game. Hauler's Dream never switches off its own work this way; its own bugs stay loud and visible, as before.

  Switching a kind of work off is the most disruptive thing this mod can do to a colony, so the rule for when it is allowed is deliberately strict — and it is about the MOD, not about who wrote the job. Hauler's Dream must be able to identify the job type that crashed, and a mod has to be demonstrably mixed up in that job type: either a mod has hooked into it, or a mod's own code is visible in the error itself. That is what lets it act on a case like Smarter Construction, which hooks into one of RimWorld's own job types — while still refusing to switch off a plain RimWorld job that merely choked on some mod's data, which would be blaming the game for a mod's mistake. Anything less and it contains the crash and says so, but changes nothing. It also never reasons from a previous moment's context: what it knows about the job being chosen is discarded the instant that choice ends, so a crash before or after work selection can no longer be pinned on whatever job happened to be considered last. Without those two rules, a badly behaved mod crashing at the wrong moment could have made Hauler's Dream shut down one innocent job type after another, causing the exact problem it is meant to prevent.

  Two fixes to Hauler's Dream's own error reporting came out of the same report. Its safety net wrote nothing at all to the log across 2673 crashes, because the note it tries to write is built from the very things that just broke; it now writes a short, unmissable marker first and the detailed note second, so the evidence survives even when the detailed note cannot be built. And it no longer decides who to blame by reading the printed text of an error — the library that prints them replaces a repeat printing with a placeholder, which was erasing exactly the lines that name the mod at fault. It now reads the error's own recorded structure instead, which nothing can overwrite, and says "could not be determined" when there is genuinely nothing to read rather than guessing. It will also never name RimWorld itself, the .NET runtime or the Harmony patching library as the mod at fault: those are present in almost every error and are not something you can report a bug to.

- 5ca40c7: Fix Hauler's Dream mislabelling other mods' errors — including flatly declaring "This is NOT a Hauler's Dream bug" — and destroying the evidence that would have named the real culprit (#236). Three separate faults in the note it writes when an error passes through code it has hooked. It read the error's details once to check whether its own code was mentioned, threw that reading away, then asked for the details a second time to write them into the log — but the Harmony library the game loads only prints a full report once and answers repeat requests with a short "duplicate, see above" placeholder, so the log got the placeholder and the lines naming the mod that actually failed were gone. It then handed the error back to the game in a way that rewrote where the error came from, replacing the real origin with whichever method Hauler's Dream happened to have hooked and erasing everything above it. And it decided whether it was involved by searching that same text for its own name — but an error's history only records what a method called, never who called it, so code further out in the chain never appears there at all. In this report that is precisely where Hauler's Dream was: its own haul-placement step was six links out from the crash, invisible to the search by construction, while the log stated flatly that the mod was uninvolved.

  The note now reads the error once and prints exactly what it read, no longer rewrites where the error came from, and never claims innocence from missing evidence — when nothing points at Hauler's Dream it says so and says plainly that this is not proof, and it now also knows when its own haul-placement step led to the error and reports that instead. It also works out its own involvement from the error's structured record rather than from printed text, so another mod printing the error first can no longer make Hauler's Dream misreport who was there. Nothing about hauling changes; this only affects what gets written to the log.

  The crash behind this report is not Hauler's Dream's: it happens inside Adaptive Storage Framework's own index of stored items, while a colonist is finishing a haul into an Adaptive Storage building. It is theirs to fix, and Hauler's Dream deliberately ships no workaround for another mod's internals — but the log now names them, so the report reaches the right place. If you are hitting it, turning off Hauler's Dream's "Haul to stack" setting narrows the window (it puts back RimWorld's rule that only one colonist at a time targets a storage tile, so fewer haulers pile onto the same spot). That is a mitigation, not a fix.

- 5ca40c7: Fix saved profiles (and freshly changed settings) losing their "Collect work results" choices on every launch.

  Every setting under "Collect work results" on the Work & yields tab — harvest, logging, mining, chunks, deep drill, deconstruction, animal products, strip, and uninstall — was being reset to "Drop, then collect" each time the game started, for every saved profile. Applying such a profile then pushed those defaults onto your live settings. The same thing happened to your live settings in two cases: on a brand-new install, if you changed any setting at any point during your first session, and after using "Reset to defaults" or picking "Default (profile, built-in)". There was no error and nothing in the log.

  The cause was a one-time upgrade step, meant to run once for configurations saved before these per-category options existed, that could not tell "this configuration is old and needs upgrading" apart from "this configuration simply never recorded which version it was written for". Profile snapshots never recorded it at all, so they were upgraded — and overwritten — on every single load. The upgrade step now looks at the actual saved data instead of at a version marker, so it runs exactly once for a genuinely old configuration and never touches anything else, and every configuration and profile now records its version properly from here on.

  Nothing needs to be re-imported and no profile has to be recreated: any values still on disk load correctly again as soon as you update. If a profile had already been written back to disk after a bad load, its nine "Collect work results" rows are gone and will need setting once more — worth a quick check of that list after updating.

  Also added a startup self-check that saves and reloads a profile through the game's own settings serializer and reports loudly if anything changes in the process, so this whole class of problem cannot come back unnoticed.

- 5ca40c7: Fix colonists shedding the food they are carrying to tame or train an animal. Send someone to tame a creature and the kibble in their pack was treated as spare stock and shipped off to a stockpile, so the job stalled and they had to go and fetch more. Two players reported it, one as "the pawn always tries to drop the kibble used for training if you manually try to tame an animal".

  This one was ours, and the gap was structural rather than a near miss. Hauler's Dream already protects a colonist's packed lunch from being unloaded, but that protection only ever covered cooked meals, and RimWorld will only let a colonist hand an animal _raw_ food. The two categories do not overlap anywhere, so nothing you can feed to an animal could ever have been covered by it. RimWorld itself does not need such a rule because it guards this food with a timer instead: a colonist who has recently fed an animal is left alone for a couple of days afterwards. Hauler's Dream's unload has no timer, so it saw the whole stack as spare and took it.

  Food is now held back while a colonist has a taming or training job in hand. That includes one still sitting in their queue behind something else, which is the case in the report, and the separate trip a colonist makes to fetch food before training, which is a job of its own and would otherwise have been missed. The amount held back is what RimWorld fetches for the job in the first place, so a colonist who happened to sweep two hundred kibble into their pack for hauling keeps a handful of it for the animal and still delivers the rest. And it releases itself: once the taming or training job is finished or gone, the food goes back to being ordinary cargo and the next unload takes it away as usual.

  Two smaller things come with it. Food a colonist is holding for an animal is no longer quietly claimed as hauling cargo to begin with — which mattered more than it sounds, because Hauler's Dream recognises its cargo by _what it is_, so once a colonist had ever swept up kibble, every later stack of kibble they picked up was claimed automatically, training food included. The "unload everything spare" sweep leaves it alone for the same reason. An explicit "Unload always" rule you have set on a food yourself still wins over all of this, exactly as it does everywhere else in the mod.

- 5ca40c7: Fix a builder walking back to the stockpile between every wall tile. A report described construction pawns appearing to "unload after every construction, running back to the stockpile after every single wall tile constructed", and switching the mod off over it. That was the right call, and it should not have been necessary: this needed no unusual settings, no particular mod combination and no large build — it happened on a fresh install with everything left at its defaults.

  The mod lets a colonist keep working through a whole run of related jobs and put its load away once at the end, so it has to decide when a run is over. Mining another vein continues the run; wandering off to cook ends it. Finishing a construction frame was counted as ending it — even though delivering the materials to that same frame counted as continuing — so the moment a wall tile went up the colonist was treated as having finished, and the end-of-run rule deliberately has no minimum trip length, because a colonist standing next to storage should still drop its load. Standing on the frame it just finished, with a stockpile ten tiles away, it did exactly that. RimWorld then re-runs the whole search for work between frames, so the decision was taken again after every single tile.

  Three things were wrong at once and all three are fixed. Construction now counts as continuing the run, so a builder mid-wall is held to the same "storage is genuinely on the way" test as a miner mid-vein rather than the relaxed end-of-run one. Construction was also the only way materials get tagged in a colonist's pack that never marked them as a fresh pick-up, so the settle period that stops anything unloading straight after a pick-up was permanently switched off for builders — leftover steel tagged a second ago looked hours old. And the mod already knew not to ship off ingredients a colonist is about to cook with; it now knows the same about building materials.

  That last part is the one worth describing, because it is what covers a builder working on its own, where there is nothing queued to look at. A colonist keeps material it is carrying when a blueprint or frame it can reach nearby still wants that exact material — the same sites, and the same radius, the mod already uses when deciding which builds to load up for in one trip. It is a hold, never a drop: nothing is put down, nothing is lost, and the material stays in the pack, still tracked, still visible, still unloadable by hand. It ends the moment any of that stops being true — the build finishes or is cancelled, the colonist is drafted or walks away, or nothing nearby wants the material any more — and there is a hard ceiling of a couple of in-game hours without picking anything up, so material can never be held indefinitely. "Unload now" ignores all of it, as always.

  One small related change: stock the mod notices in a colonist's pack that it did not put there itself — from a trade, another mod, or your own hand-loading — now waits out the same short settle period as everything else before its first automatic trip to storage, instead of being shipped off the instant it is spotted. It is picked up on the next pass rather than that one.

- 5ca40c7: Stop the new corpse sweeping from quietly burying bodies with their gear still on, for anyone whose auto-strip is set to "disposal hauls only".

  That setting means "undress a body when it is on its way to a grave, not when it is just being tidied into a stockpile", and Hauler's Dream recognises which is which by the job the colonist is doing: RimWorld's own carry-to-a-grave counts, a stockpile haul does not. A bulk sweep is neither — the colonist picks the body up before anything has decided where it is going — so a swept body is not treated as a burial and is not undressed.

  Until corpses joined the sweep that cost nothing, because a colonist never bulk-hauled a body on their own initiative: every automatic trip to a grave was RimWorld's own carry, which undresses. Letting the automatic scan pick bodies up would have changed that for people who had changed no setting at all, and the first they would know of it is a grave full of dressed corpses.

  So on that one setting the automatic corpse sweep stands down and bodies go by the old route, which still undresses them. Asking for it yourself is unaffected: "Pick up", "Haul everything nearby" and prioritising a haul on a body all still sweep, exactly as they did before this release. Every other auto-strip setting is unaffected too — "every haul" undresses the body when it is picked up either way, and with auto-strip off there is nothing to protect.

  Also: a sweep no longer takes a carcass a wild animal is in the middle of eating. RimWorld's own corpse hauling refuses those, and the sweep was not asking.

- 5ca40c7: Stop Hauler's Dream adding a hauling trip in front of an order you gave. Shift-click two corpses to strip and the colonist would strip the first, set off to collect and deliver something else, and only come back for the second afterwards, instead of working through your list in the order you set it. Ordering a colonist to tame an animal picked up the same detour on the way, which is also how the animal's food ended up sitting in the job queue long enough to be shipped off (fixed separately in this release).

  RimWorld is deliberate about this. Its own "grab something on the way past" behaviour asks whether the job it is about to attach itself to is one you explicitly ordered, and stands down if it is: a job you asked for is not one it will pad out. Hauler's Dream's version of that behaviour copied every other condition RimWorld applies and missed exactly that one, so on precisely the orders RimWorld leaves alone, RimWorld declined and Hauler's Dream stepped in. It now asks the same question, so the two agree again.

  Work a colonist finds for itself is untouched, and that is where grabbing something on the way past actually earns its keep. RimWorld's own opportunistic hauling is untouched too: Hauler's Dream only ever adds to it when RimWorld found nothing to grab.

- 5ca40c7: Fix a Strip order you place by hand silently doing nothing on some corpses. A Steam report described colonists that would "neither strip the corpse while moving them nor when you force them to strip". It only happens once you set one of the "Tainted apparel" policies to "leave it on the corpse", and from then on it happens every time, which is why it read as intermittent.

  That setting tells Hauler's Dream not to take those pieces off the body, which is exactly what it should do. RimWorld's own "is there anything to strip here?" check knew nothing about it, though, so a body wearing nothing but kept-on-corpse clothing still counted as strippable. You could place the order, the colonist walked over, worked at the body, cleared the designation, removed nothing, and the game recorded a body stripped. Because the body still looked strippable afterwards you could designate it again, and again, with the same result each time.

  That check now knows the rule. A body whose remaining clothing is all set to stay on it is no longer offered for stripping: the strip tool will not mark it, an order you already placed hands out no work, and a strip job already under way stops before it can clear its own designation, so the order stays visible instead of quietly disappearing. Bodies with anything worth taking are completely unaffected — a weapon, something in the pockets, or any piece not covered by a "leave it on the corpse" policy still strips exactly as before, and everything except the pieces you asked to leave comes off. Living prisoners are untouched, since leaving clothes on the body has only ever applied to the dead. With the default "take it" settings nothing changes at all, which is why most players never ran into this.

  Stripping a corpse before cremating it is deliberately left alone: there the body is about to burn, so it is still worth stripping for the weapons and pocket contents, and the clothes you asked to leave on it go into the fire with it. That is the clean disposal the setting promises.

  The "leave it on the corpse" option now says as much in the settings, in every language: the piece is never taken off by any strip, including one you order by hand.

- 5ca40c7: Stop Hauler's Dream putting a storage trip in the middle of a sequence of orders you queued. Shift-click two corpses to strip and the colonist would strip the first, walk the loot back to base, and only then come back for the second, instead of working through your list in the order you set it. The same thing could happen anywhere a queue of orders fills a colonist's pack partway through — a row of plants to harvest, a line of cells to mine.

  The rule that is supposed to prevent this already exists: an automatic trip to storage never goes in front of work you have queued. What went wrong is that the pack filling up marks its trip as deliberate, so it skips that rule — and it has to, because it also needs to skip the short settle period after a pick-up and to work at all for players who have automatic unloading switched off. Skipping those two things was intended. Skipping the queue was not, and there was already a way to say so: the trip that runs when a bulk haul finishes has always been able to say "put me behind anything the player has queued". The full-pack trip now says the same thing, and so does the one at the end of a batch of crafting. All three still happen — they just wait their turn.

  Worth being straight about the limit. A colonist whose pack is full can still carry out a queued strip, mine or harvest order; the difference is that what it produces stays on the ground as an ordinary haulable for someone to collect, rather than the colonist breaking off mid-list to make room. Nothing is stranded or lost, and the colonist makes its storage trip as soon as your list is done.

  Two things are deliberately unchanged. "Unload now" still goes to the front of everything, because that button means now. And the quick scoop that collects the gear your strip order just produced, at the corpse's feet, still runs first — deferring that one would leave the loot for other haulers and defeat the order you gave.

  One knock-on fix comes with it. When a colonist's pack filled mid-scoop it used to put the stack it could not take back on its own to-collect list, on the assumption that the storage trip about to happen would make room. With that trip now waiting behind your orders, the assumption no longer holds, so the colonist would have walked to the stack, taken nothing, and queued it again. In that case the stack is simply left for ordinary hauling instead — the same thing already done for players using strict carry weight or "keep working when full".

- 5ca40c7: Translate four entries that were still showing in English to Traditional Chinese players.

  The route planner's two tag buttons read "S" and "E", and the carry-weight cap read "{0} kg". Traditional Chinese now shows 始 and 終 on the buttons and 公斤 for the unit, matching the wording already used elsewhere in that translation.

  The line explaining the buttons was updated in the same pass, so it points at the characters actually on them rather than at "S" and "E". Getting one without the other would have been worse than leaving both alone — it is how several other translations currently read.

- 5ca40c7: Fix a colonist standing still for a long time instead of getting on with the rest of its load. When a colonist set off to put something away and then could not actually walk to the destination — a shelf that has just been walled in, a stockpile behind a doorway someone is standing in, a container another mod has moved somewhere awkward — RimWorld ends the trip and has the colonist wait a few seconds. Hauler's Dream then dropped the load on the floor, picked it straight back up, and sent the colonist at the same unreachable destination again, on exactly the same rhythm as that wait. The colonist could stay on "Standing" for hours with a full pack.

  Now a stack whose destination cannot be reached is put back in the pack instead of dropped, set aside for the rest of that trip, and left alone for about ten seconds before anything offers it again. The colonist carries on delivering everything else it is holding and comes back to that one later, once the way is clear. If several destinations in a row turn out to be unreachable, the colonist ends the trip early and keeps the load rather than pacing. Nothing is lost or forgotten either way — the goods stay tracked in the pack and go out on the next trip. A plain RimWorld haul that fails to reach its cell now counts towards the same protection, so it too is left for a moment rather than retried on the spot.

  The same "skip this one and keep going" recovery now also covers the trips that gather goods for a transporter, a map portal, a vehicle, a pack animal, a refuelling job or a construction site: one pile that cannot be reached no longer throws away everything the colonist had already collected for that trip.

  A room of shelves that has been sealed off permanently was already handled correctly and is unchanged. Colonists never pick storage they cannot reach in the first place, so they simply leave those goods for storage they can get to.

## 1.21.0

### Minor Changes

- e23d72e: Add a "Max carry weight" setting: an absolute per-trip cap, in kilograms, on how much a pawn loads into its inventory when hauling, gathering yields, or loading a caravan, pack animal, or transporter. It works on top of the "Carry limit" percentage and Smart overload, and the lower limit always wins, so the cap is never exceeded even with overload on. This is the direct answer to "my pawns carry too much" (and to "strict carry weight still carries very large quantities"): set it low, say 20 kg, and pawns gather a small load, unload, and come back, in a concrete unit rather than a percentage of each pawn's capacity. Off by default (0 = no limit), so existing saves are unchanged. Like the Carry limit, it counts only inventory (not a stack carried in the hands) and does not change how much material a pawn fetches for a specific build or bill.
- 40a378b: Add an opt-in "Strip gear before cremating" option (#222). When enabled, a corpse about to be cremated (or burned in an incinerator) has its weapons, apparel and carried items dropped onto the crematorium tile first, so they can be hauled to storage instead of being destroyed with the body. Off by default. Tainted apparel follows the existing tainted-apparel policies, and "Also strip player-faction corpses" still decides whether your own dead are stripped. Covers both normal and batched cremation bills.
- 40a378b: Add an "Only on maps you control" option under "Also work on caravan / non-home maps". When Hauler's Dream is working off your home colony, you can now limit it to maps you actually control (your home, a temporary camp or settled site, and any map where you have built storage) so it stands down on maps you are only passing through or attacking, such as ambush sites and enemy bases. Off by default, preserving the current behavior of working on all non-home maps.
- 40a378b: Add bulk backpack pickup for "Haul Urgently" items (Allow Tool and Keyz' Allow Utilities). When a pawn is sent to urgently haul an item, it now also pockets other urgent-marked stacks within a short, adjustable radius and carries the whole cluster in one trip, instead of fetching them one at a time. On by default with a 3-tile radius. An opt-in sub-option also lets urgent trips grab nearby ordinary haulables and use opportunistic pickup. This also fixes Hauler's Dream not recognizing Keyz' Allow Utilities urgent marks at all, which had left those hauls one-at-a-time even with bulk hauling on.

### Patch Changes

- e23d72e: Clamp bulk-refuel to the smart-overload carry-weight ceiling. The bulk-refuel courier sized its inventory sweep purely by the refuelable's fuel deficit, with no carry-weight limit, so it was the only into-inventory path that ignored the overload ceiling every other path (bulk hauling, transporter / portal / vehicle bulk-load) respects. Under strict carry weight that let a refuel courier load past 100% of its carry weight, contradicting the mod's own carry-limit contract; with heavy or modded fuels and a high-capacity refuelable it could overload badly. Bulk-refuel now uses the same ceiling as every other path: 100% of carry weight under strict carry weight, the "Off" slider, or Combat Extended; the configured break-even overload at other slider stops; and unbounded at "no slowdown" (so that stop is unchanged). A sweep the ceiling trims deposits what it carries and a later trip tops up the rest, exactly like the existing partial-sweep path. A new pure RefuelPlan.TakeFromStack helper and its oracle tests pin the deficit-and-ceiling clamp.
- e23d72e: Clarify the "strict carry weight" and "Drop, then collect" tooltips. A Steam report noted that pawns "carry very large quantities" with strict carry weight on and every yield set to "Drop, then collect", and asked whether it was a bug. It is working as intended: strict carry weight caps a pawn's inventory at 100% of its carry WEIGHT (a full load is still a lot of stacks), and that cap applies the same whether yields go "Collect directly" or "Drop, then collect". The only difference is that "Drop, then collect" leaves each yield on the floor first, where your other haulers and Bulk hauling also sweep it into their packs, each still capped at 100%. The tooltips now say this and point at the "Carry limit" slider as the lever for smaller loads, and a regression test pins the strict cap so it cannot silently drift on that path.
- e23d72e: Fill in the missing translations across all 14 non-English languages. A number of settings and labels had shipped as English placeholders in the other locales (including the new "Max carry weight" cap and several strings added in recent releases, such as the urgent-haul pickup options, "strip before cremation", non-home-map scoping, and the fishing yield rows). These are now translated in Chinese (Simplified), Danish, Dutch, French, German, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Polish, Portuguese (Brazilian), Russian, Spanish, Thai, and Ukrainian, matching each file's existing terminology and register. Brand names, unit symbols, and placeholder tokens are preserved.
- 40a378b: Fix pawns trying to unload a carried sidearm weapon (#222). With Simple Sidearms (or Grab Your Tool) and "put away surplus inventory" turned on, a pawn carrying both a remembered sidearm and a looted copy of the same weapon could tag its own sidearm for unloading and put it away. Remembered sidearms and carried tools are now excluded from surplus adoption, matching every other place Hauler's Dream already protects them, so a colonist keeps the weapons it chose to carry and only the looted duplicate is hauled off.
- 40a378b: Fix the "Prioritize hauling" order always sweeping like "Haul everything nearby", ignoring the bulk-haul trigger setting (#223). An internal carve-out that lets an oversized stack ride in the inventory in one trip was also, unintentionally, triggering the full neighborhood sweep, so with stack-size mods almost every ordered haul swept everything and the "only from the second order" setting had no effect. A single ordered haul now honors the bulk-haul trigger: it carries the one (even oversized) stack without sweeping unless bulk hauling is set to Always or a second nearby haul has also been ordered.
- 40a378b: Fix surplus not being unloaded after setting a "keep in inventory" amount (#225). If a pawn already carried some of an item and you then told it to keep a number of that item, a save upgraded from an older version could pin the keep amount to the pawn's whole held stack, so the extra above the kept number was never put away. The keep amount now excludes items the pawn is carrying to haul, and the keep order schedules the surplus for unloading, so a pawn keeping 7 of an item while holding 9 now delivers the extra 2.

## 1.20.5

### Patch Changes

- 01149a2: Ordering a builder to construct now reserves the site's materials for that builder, so other pawns stop piling on.

  Previously, when you told a colonist to construct a building, another pawn (or a work drone) could start hauling the same materials to the frame at the same time. The ordered builder would walk to the site, find it not yet buildable, and wander off, over and over, until the helper finished. It could happen even when the builder was already carrying the exact materials needed. The ordered builder now takes the frame over from any pawns already hauling to it (interrupting their redundant trips) and claims the delivery for itself, the way vanilla already does for a forced haul. Autonomous hauling is unchanged, so unordered deliveries still coordinate normally.

## 1.20.4

### Patch Changes

- fdbc023: Stop the last way colonists could loop forever at a RimIOT (Logistic Matrix) terminal.

  Earlier fixes stopped colonists picking loose items back up around a full terminal, but the loop could still "occasionally" come back. The real, deepest cause was different: RimIOT redirects a colonist who is walking to fetch an item, sending them to its terminal to grab a matching item straight out of the network instead. When Hauler's Dream had upgraded that fetch into a bulk haul, the colonist would pull the item out of the network and immediately carry it back in, moving nothing, forever, with no error to show for it.

  Hauler's Dream now leaves delivery into a RimIOT network to RimIOT: when an automatic haul is headed for network storage it keeps the plain vanilla haul (which RimIOT handles correctly) instead of turning it into a bulk haul. As a second safety net, if another mod ever swaps a bulk haul's target out from under Hauler's Dream mid-job, the colonist no longer pockets the substituted network item, and Hauler's Dream backs that item off and prints one clear warning naming what happened, so a future loop of this shape is surfaced instead of silently repeating. None of this has any effect when RimIOT is not installed, and a forced "Haul" order always works as before.

- 2ea8587: The "Unload inventory" pawn button now unloads immediately on a plain click, and queues on Shift+click.

  Previously the button always added the unload behind the pawn's current job, so the pawn finished what it was doing first. Now a plain left-click makes the pawn drop its current job and go unload right away, which is what most people expect from the button. If you would rather keep the old behavior for a specific click, hold Shift while clicking and the unload is added to the job queue to run after the current job instead. There is no new setting, and automatic unloading is unchanged.

## 1.20.3

### Patch Changes

- 46c173a: Fix "leave on corpse" tainted apparel policy for manual strip orders (#211)

  When a player issues a manual Strip order on a corpse, vanilla's Pawn.Strip calls
  apparel.DropAll which strips everything — including tainted pieces the player's
  per-category policy says to leave on the body. The pieces dropped to the ground
  were then forbidden in place by HD's post-strip handler (degraded to DropAndForbid
  because it couldn't put them back on the corpse). A prefix on
  Pawn_ApparelTracker.DropAll now filters out LeaveOnCorpse pieces when the pawn is
  dead, so they stay on the body and travel with the corpse as intended.

## 1.20.2

### Patch Changes

- d984603: Increase Player.log attachment from 400 KB to the backend's 5 MB cap

  The report system was attaching only the last 400 KB of Player.log, which truncated
  away the first occurrences of critical stack traces in heavily-modded saves (e.g.
  issue #207's HD bulk-haul and alert NREs were only visible as "Duplicate stacktrace"
  markers). The backend accepts up to 5 MB per log, so this increases the tail to that
  cap — capturing the full Player.log for most saves.

## 1.20.1

### Patch Changes

- 4529c9f: Closes #204 — Combat Extended loadout meals (and other generic-slot items like drugs and medicine) were being unloaded to storage and immediately re-fetched by CE's JobGiver_UpdateLoadout, creating a constant loop.

  CE loadouts use two kinds of slots: specific (a concrete ThingDef like "MealSimple") and generic (a LoadoutGenericDef whose lambda predicate matches a category, e.g. "any meal" or "any medicine"). The basic generics — GenericMeal, GenericDrugs, GenericMedicine — are added to every CE loadout automatically. HD's LoadoutKeepCount only checked specific slots (LoadoutSlot.thingDef), so generic slots were invisible: the keep count for meals was 0, only FoodKeepCountOf partially shielded them, and the excess was shipped to storage.

  LoadoutKeepCount now evaluates generic slots too, invoking the slot's LoadoutGenericDef.lambda predicate on the ThingDef to determine a match. If the lambda accepts the def, the slot's count is added to the keep total, preventing the unload↔refetch loop.

## 1.20.0

### Minor Changes

- 97865a7: Eat, tend, and build from a vehicle's cargo when away from home (three new opt-in options for nomad runs).

  If you use Vehicle Framework and travel with your base packed into vehicles, unpacking food, medicine, and building materials every time you settle for a while is tedious. Three new options extend the "Meals on Wheels" idea to a parked vehicle's cargo, treating it like a pack animal you can draw from:

  A hungry colonist can eat food stored in a vehicle's cargo. A doctor with no reachable medicine on the map can tend using medicine carried in a vehicle, on a pack animal, or by another colonist, still respecting the patient's medical-care policy. A builder can pull construction materials from a vehicle's cargo.

  All three are off by default and apply only on a non-home map (a caravan or temporary map), so a base's curated vehicle loadout is never touched. They appear in the mod options only when Vehicle Framework is installed, alongside the existing Meals on Wheels and Build from inventory toggles.

### Patch Changes

- 97865a7: Stop the unload and re-pickup loop for items a Compositable Loadouts loadout tells a pawn to keep (#200).

  With Compositable Loadouts, a pawn assigned a loadout that keeps something (for example, medicine) would have Hauler's Dream haul it away as surplus, then the loadout would send the pawn to pick it back up, over and over. Hauler's Dream now counts what a pawn's Compositable Loadout keeps as inventory that pawn should hold onto, so it leaves that amount alone and only hauls away the true surplus. The back-and-forth stops.

  This reads the loadout through reflection and does nothing when Compositable Loadouts is not installed.

- 97865a7: Crafters now drop hauled items into storage on the way to the next craft, instead of carrying them through and dropping them on the floor (#201).

  When a crafter grabbed a loose item on the way to a workbench (the "while you're up" pickup), it could carry that item all the way through the craft and then stand around before finally dropping it on the ground. Now, when a crafter is about to start a crafting or cooking bill and a stockpile sits roughly on the way to its ingredients, it drops the carried surplus off there first, so the item reaches storage while the pawn is fetching materials for the next craft.

  This reuses the same "drop it off on the way" behavior doctors already use during elective surgery, honors the existing unload detour distance setting, and never sheds the materials the imminent craft itself needs.

- 97865a7: "Haul Urgently" fills backpacks again when Combat Extended is installed alongside Allow Tool or Keyz' Allow Utilities.

  The "Haul Urgently" order (from Allow Tool and its lighter reimplementation Keyz' Allow Utilities) is meant to sweep nearby items into a pawn's inventory in one trip, like the rest of Hauler's Dream. With Combat Extended present, an urgent haul was falling back to carrying a single stack by hand instead. An urgent haul is a deliberate command, so it now sweeps the whole nearby cluster into the backpack as intended, the same way "Haul everything nearby" does, while a lone bulky stack with nothing around it still travels by hand.

- 97865a7: The "couldn't unload inventory" alert no longer points players at supported mods.

  When a pawn was stuck unable to put its hauled items away, the alert suggested a mod might be canceling the unload and, in following that advice, players were disabling mods Hauler's Dream actually supports (such as Simple Sidearms). The message now leads with checking that there is accessible, unforbidden storage with space, and explicitly says the mods Hauler's Dream integrates with (Simple Sidearms, Smart Medicine, Combat Extended, Grab Your Tool, Item Policy) are not the cause and should not be disabled.

## 1.19.0

### Minor Changes

- 363b4cf: Choose how much to keep in inventory, set it from the Gear tab, and smoother shuttle/route menus.

  "Keep in inventory" now lets you pick an amount. Right-clicking a stack and choosing "Keep in inventory" opens a slider (just like the vanilla "pick up some" dialog) so you can hold an exact amount, such as 50 silver, instead of the whole stack. Hauler's Dream keeps that many and treats the rest as surplus to haul away, and the game's "drop unused inventory" cleanup leaves the kept amount alone.

  A new keep control on the Gear tab. Hover any item in a colonist's inventory to set how many of it that pawn should hold onto; items being kept always show the amount, so you can see and change it at a glance. Setting the amount to 0 stops keeping. It can be turned off in the mod options if you would rather not see it. (Kept amounts save with your game and sync in multiplayer.)

  Performance. Right-clicking a shuttle or transporter that has a load list no longer re-plans the whole load several times while building the menu; the plan is now reused within the same click, so opening the menu is lighter. The route planner also reuses its per-target work lookup within a click. Closing the mod options window fully restores framerate, as the settings screen only does work while it is open.

### Patch Changes

- 363b4cf: Fix a compatibility crash on malformed modded pawns, and stop foreign errors being blamed on Hauler's Dream (#197).

  Some modded pawns, such as a Dead Man's Switch "humanoid mech" summoned by WVC's voidlink, are built in a way that makes RimWorld's own work-type check throw whenever anything asks whether they can do a job (vanilla reads a couple of pawn fields without confirming they exist). Hauler's Dream offers hauling to mechs, so it was one of the things asking, and a single broken pawn could interrupt a hauling scan. Hauler's Dream now treats such a pawn as unable to do that work and moves on, reporting the fault once with the real source named, so one malformed pawn no longer disrupts hauling.

  It also no longer stamps its own name onto errors that merely pass through the two work-type methods it lightly patches. When the real cause is vanilla or another mod, the error now keeps its true origin in the log instead of pointing back at Hauler's Dream, so these get reported to the right place. The underlying summon failure itself is a defect in the other mods' pawn setup, not something Hauler's Dream can fix, but it no longer makes things worse or takes the blame.

## 1.18.2

### Patch Changes

- 0e3562b: Fix a stray Common Sense warning and make "cook with the most-stocked ingredient first" actually apply under Common Sense (follow-up to #192).

  The previous release asked some Common Sense users to report a message about a cooking-sort hook that "did not resolve". That was Hauler's Dream looking for the hook in the wrong place: Common Sense keeps it under a slightly different name depending on which version you run. Hauler's Dream now finds it in both, so the message is gone and the most-stocked-first cooking option layers onto Common Sense's order as intended. When a future Common Sense build genuinely moves it, the option quietly falls back to Hauler's Dream's own batch-cook handling with no warning, since it is off by default.

## 1.18.1

### Patch Changes

- 08f09d2: Fix the RimIOT terminal haul loop and make "cook with the most-stocked ingredient first" work under Common Sense (issue #192).

  When a RimIOT (Logistic Matrix) network is full it drops the carried stack on the ground by the interaction terminal, which colonists could keep re-collecting and re-unloading forever. The gate that leaves those drops to RimIOT now recognises every interface-terminal type by its building class (so a renamed or extra terminal variant is still covered) and reaches a bit farther from the terminal, since the overflow drop can scatter several tiles when the space around a full terminal is crowded. Items are only ever left for RimIOT and normal hauling to collect, never lost.

  "Cook with the most-stocked ingredient first" now also works when Common Sense is installed. Common Sense takes over the cooking-ingredient order, and this option had no effect on its own before; it now layers on top, so cooks reach for the ingredient the colony has the most of while Common Sense's freshness order is kept within each ingredient. It stays off by default and does nothing to non-cooking bills.

## 1.18.0

### Minor Changes

- 4a80b83: Collect harvested and drilled yields consistently, with visible drops.

  Under "Drop & haul", a harvested or cut plant's yield drops on the ground and is then collected, but the timing now depends on how the plants are laid out. When a pawn works through plants close together (within two tiles of the previous one), their yields pile up visibly and are swept in sections, like harvesting a field. A one-off harvest with nothing next to it drops visibly and is picked up on the spot, so the pawn no longer leaves it and wanders off. Deep-drill output is also collected as the drill runs instead of only when it is exhausted. A pawn still leaves a yield on the ground when it has nowhere to store it or is already carrying too much.

  A new option on the Work & yields tab, "Delay directly collected harvests" (off by default), shows the pickup-delay progress bar for those on-the-spot harvest pickups too. It just needs the pickup delay to be set above zero; one-off ordered harvests stay quick to collect unless you opt in.

### Patch Changes

- 4a80b83: Respect "leave non-smeltable clothing on corpses" for loose apparel too.

  With the keep-on-corpse policy set, tainted clothing that had already come off a corpse and was lying on the ground (from a manual Strip order, a butchering or cremation bill at a bench, or a corpse rotting away) was still hauled off to storage. Hauler's Dream now leaves such pieces where they are across all of its automatic pickup paths, and forbids a manually-stripped piece so nothing hauls it, matching what the setting promises. The default policy (take and smelt) is unchanged.

- 4a80b83: Stop several pawns diverting to the same small transport-loading need.

  When a transport pod, drop capsule, or vehicle needed only a small remaining amount of an item, several pawns who were already carrying that item would all divert to deliver it at once. Only one was needed, so the rest arrived to a filled manifest and had to carry their cargo back. An opportunistic delivery now reserves the amount it will bring against that target, so other carrying pawns see the remaining need already covered and keep to their original jobs. The reservation is released if the delivery is interrupted.

- 4a80b83: Fix a frame-rate drop when typing in the settings search box.

  Typing in the settings-window search field could stutter the game: the search re-scored every registered option from scratch on each keystroke (allocating heavily inside its typo-tolerance matching) and rebuilt its grouped results every frame. The search now reuses its scratch buffers, lowercases the option text once when the list is built, and caches the grouped results per query, so typing stays smooth.

  Note: a hard cap to 60 FPS while any text field is focused comes from a separate frame-limiter mod, not from Hauler's Dream.

- 4a80b83: Stop the diagnostic log from flooding when another mod faults every tick.

  Hauler's Dream tags any error that passes through a method it patches, so a report shows whether the mod was involved (it usually isn't — the tag says so). When another mod's fault repeats every tick, such as a broken pawn whose AI keeps throwing, that tag was written on every occurrence and could fill Hauler's Dream's own report log with hundreds of identical lines, crowding out the rest of its history. The first occurrence is now logged in full, with the stack that names the real source, and the repeats are collapsed to a short recurring note, so the report stays useful. The error itself is still passed through unchanged, exactly as before.

## 1.17.1

### Patch Changes

- cdffe98: Stop colonists looping forever at a full RimIOT interface terminal.

  With RimIOT (Logistic Matrix), when a logistic network fills up its interface terminal drops the item a colonist was depositing onto the ground right next to the terminal. Hauler's Dream would then keep scooping that loose stack back up and trying to store it into the still-full network, over and over, so a pair of colonists could get stuck shuffling the same stack (for example a large pile of leather) between "haul all nearby items" and "unload inventory" indefinitely.

  Hauler's Dream now leaves loose items in the small area around a powered interface terminal to RimIOT, on every automatic pickup path, so the loop can no longer form. This also closes the same gap on the "grab items on the way to a job" path, which the earlier RimIOT fix did not cover. There is no effect when RimIOT is not installed.

## 1.17.0

### Minor Changes

- f14d0ee: Add guiding placeholder text to the in-game "Report an issue" description box.

  The description box now shows greyed example prompts that change with the report type, so it is clearer what to write. A bug report suggests noting what happened, what you expected, and when it happens; a feature request asks for the change and why it would help; a compatibility report asks which mod conflicts and what goes wrong with both enabled. The hint disappears the moment you start typing. It is translated into all 14 supported languages.

### Patch Changes

- 27f3a92: Stop Hauler's Dream from disabling Common Sense's spoiling-ingredient cooking sort.

  Both mods reorder a cooking bill's ingredients by rewriting the same piece of game code, and only one can win, so depending on load order Hauler's Dream could win and silently switch off Common Sense's default spoilage-first sort (sometimes with a one-time yellow "[Common Sense] ... patch 0 didn't work" log line). Hauler's Dream now steps aside from that sort whenever Common Sense is installed, so Common Sense's feature always works. Hauler's Dream's own spoilage sort is the same idea Common Sense provides, so a default cook is unaffected, and its separate batch-cooking picker still honors Hauler's Dream's cook-order options either way.

  A code-level investigation (cloning Common Sense) also confirmed that running the two mods together is not the cause of the red errors some players attributed to it: no Hauler's Dream fault was found in the interaction. Hauler's Dream tags any error it is responsible for with its own name, so a red error's stack trace shows whether it belongs to Hauler's Dream or elsewhere.

- 27f3a92: Verify and strengthen compatibility with the 1.6 multithreading and performance mods (RimThreaded, RimSmooth).

  A code-level investigation (including cloning RimThreaded's source) confirmed Hauler's Dream stays compatible with the multithreading and performance mods available for 1.6: RimThreaded - Continued parallelizes only particles, background random numbers, and sound, and RimSmooth is single-threaded, so neither runs Hauler's Dream's hauling or job code across threads. Hauler's Dream was already built for thread-safety on its busy code paths. As forward-insurance for a future mod that threads pawn AI, two internal per-tick caches were hardened to match their already thread-safe siblings, with no change to how the mod behaves for anyone.

## 1.16.13

### Patch Changes

- 63cd8f9: Fix the "Unload inventory" button appearing wedged among a leader's ability buttons instead of at the end of the command bar (issue #140).

  Hauler's Dream adds two per-pawn command buttons, an auto-haul toggle and an "Unload inventory" action. Their sort position was set to a middling value, which usually put them near the end but could strand them in the middle of the row when a pawn had many buttons whose own sort values straddled it. This was most visible on an ideoligion leader, whose ability buttons pushed the Unload button into their midst. The two buttons now sort to the very end of the command bar, with Unload last, so they no longer interleave with abilities or anything else. An earlier attempt at this blamed an unrelated mod and did not actually move the buttons; this one fixes the sort itself.

- 63cd8f9: Load shuttles and transport pods starting from the item nearest the colonist rather than the item nearest the shuttle, to cut out wasteful back-and-forth (issue #171).

  When a colonist some distance from a shuttle was told to load it, Hauler's Dream planned the pickup order starting from the item closest to the shuttle, so the colonist would walk past nearby items to grab a far one first and then double back. It now plans the order starting from the colonist's own position and collects along a sensible path, grabbing what is on the way instead of crossing the map and returning. Which items and how many get loaded is unchanged, since this only affects the order they are collected in, so the earlier fix for loading the correct quality and quantity (issue #156) is preserved.

- 63cd8f9: Stop the planner right-click options from appearing for colonists that cannot do the work, and add an option to also hide them for colonists not assigned to it (issue #176).

  The route and craft planner options could still show up on a colonist incapable of the underlying work in some cases, such as a research bench offering a hauling route, or a sowing route on a colonist below the plant's required sowing skill. Those now stay hidden, matching how the base game gates the same work.

  There is also a new setting, "Plan work for unassigned pawns" (under Planning tools, on by default so existing behavior is unchanged). Turn it off to also hide the planner for a colonist who is capable of the work but has that work type unchecked in its Work tab, so only colonists actually assigned to the work are offered it. Colonists who simply cannot do the work are always hidden regardless of this setting. Translations for all supported languages are included.

- 63cd8f9: Fix colonists looping forever between hauling and unloading at a RimIOT (Logistic Matrix) terminal instead of eating or resting (issue #177).

  With RimIOT and a stack-size-increasing mod both installed, a stored item could sit as two partial stacks that can never merge into one (for example 400 and 700 against a limit of 1000). Hauler's Dream would sweep both partials into a colonist's inventory, haul them back, and steer each deposit toward a partial stack again, while RimIOT re-spread them, so the same colonist swept and unloaded the same items every few seconds without end and eventually starved. RimIOT settles these stacks on its own when left alone; the trouble was Hauler's Dream repeatedly picking them back up before it could.

  Hauler's Dream now recognizes storage that belongs to a RimIOT network and keeps its bulk sweep and its stack-topping out of it, letting RimIOT manage its own contents. This only activates when RimIOT is installed and changes nothing for anyone not running it. Regular hauling to and from ordinary storage is unaffected, and directly ordered hauls still work on network items.

- 63cd8f9: Fix colonists getting stuck forever trying to start a large batch craft when they cannot carry all the ingredients in one trip, most often under Combat Extended.

  When a batch crafting job needed more ingredients than a colonist could carry at once (common under Combat Extended, or with strict carry weight and overloading turned off), the colonist would pick up as much as it could, find it still could not make even one item, haul everything back to storage, and immediately start the same job again, looping without ever crafting or resting. It was worst for recipes that mix ingredients (cooked meals, kibble, pemmican, chemfuel, beer), where the plan did not account for bulk at all, so the colonist could gather a full load and still be unable to craft a single item.

  Now a colonist gathers only as many whole crafting rounds as actually fit its carry capacity on each trip, picking up every ingredient type in proportion instead of filling up on one, crafts them, then goes back for more until the batch is done. The batch size itself is never reduced because of carry capacity, since other mods can change how much a pawn carries and that is not something to generalize on. If a single round genuinely cannot be carried, the batch quietly steps aside and lets the base game craft one at a time rather than looping. Colonists that can overload as normal are unaffected.

## 1.16.12

### Patch Changes

- e0a30ca: Let a colonist grab a loose item it walks over on its way to store things away.

  A hauler carrying scooped goods to the shelves would step right over a loose item on the floor, even one on its exact path, and leave it for a second trip. That is because the scoop-on-the-way behavior only kicks in when a colonist sets off toward other work; once it is already on a storage run, it could not pick anything else up.

  Now, while a colonist is walking to storage, it grabs a loose haulable that sits on that path, so the item rides along on a trip it was making anyway. By default it only does this for a short detour at most, so the trip is barely affected, and how far it will step out of its way is adjustable (see the new "Grab-on-the-way detour" setting under Routing). It still leaves alone anything reserved by someone else, forbidden, or with nowhere better to go.

- e0a30ca: Fix a colonist pacing back and forth forever carrying an item in a cramped room (issue #162).

  When an item sits on a spot the game wants cleared for other work (an ingredient cell of a workbench mid-bill, a growing or mining or construction spot), the base game keeps hauling it "aside" to the nearest free tile. In a tight room that nearest free tile is the adjacent spot the game also wants cleared, so the item gets shuffled between two cells endlessly, a fresh short haul every half second, and a colonist can spend all day on it. This is a base-game behaviour rather than something Hauler's Dream causes, but because the mod keeps colonists hauling until their queue runs dry, an idle hauler would reliably fall into it.

  The earlier attempts at this bug all watched for the wrong kind of haul (a haul toward storage that fails), while this loop is a haul aside that succeeds every time, so none of them ever saw it. Now, the moment a colonist hauls an item aside, Hauler's Dream stops offering to haul that same item aside again for a while. The one haul that clears the work spot still happens, so the item is relocated a single time, but the back-and-forth shuffle can never start, and the colonist goes on to do something useful with it (often hauling it to storage) instead of pacing. As long as the work spot keeps demanding to be cleared the item stays put, so the shuffle cannot start up again later either. Nothing about normal storage hauling is affected.

- e0a30ca: Add two "detour distance" settings that control how far pawns step out of their way to take a free opportunity, each showing the extra-tile budget.

  Two separate behaviors let a colonist make the most of a trip it is already taking, and each now has its own knob. Both use the same four levels, and the picker shows the extra-tile budget so the choice is not just a bare word (Off = 0, Short = about 4, Standard = about 10, Long = about 20 extra tiles of travel):

  - "Grab-on-the-way detour" (under Routing) sets how far a pawn already walking to storage will step aside to grab a loose item it passes. Default Standard (about 10 tiles). Only applies while en-route pickup is on.
  - "Unload detour during important work" (its own section in the Unloading tab, tied to automatic unloading) sets how far a pawn on non-emergency medical, rescue, or warden work will step aside to drop a scooped load at storage, typically on the trip out to fetch the operation's medicine. Default Short (about 4 tiles), so a doctor sheds the load on a near-free pass-by instead of only when storage is exactly on the path.

  Each level is measured as extra straight-line tiles over going straight, so a little goes further on a long haul. Off turns the behavior off entirely: a hauler leaves items it walks past, and a doctor carries its load through the whole task. True emergencies such as tending the wounded are never diverted, whatever the unload setting.

- e0a30ca: Fix colonists endlessly pacing when unloading unstackable items (extracted organs, body parts) from inventory in a crowded hospital or prison.

  The unload driver dropped the destination cell reservation for ALL items when Haul To Stack was on — including unstackables like kidneys, which can never share a cell. Without the reservation, another hauler could fill the same cell mid-carry, invalidating it, causing the carry toil to fail and drop the item at the pawn's feet. The item was then re-scooped and re-unloaded, creating the reported endless pacing loop. Stackable items (hemogen packs) were unaffected because the in-flight re-route layer actively redirected them — but that layer deliberately skipped unstackables, leaving them with zero protection on the unload path. The unload driver now reserves the destination cell for unstackables, mirroring the guard the vanilla HaulToCell patch already applies. Also fixes a NullReferenceException in the cannot-unload alert when a scanned item is destroyed mid-scan.

- e0a30ca: Let a colonist shed scooped items during elective medical work when its storage is right on the way.

  Hauler's Dream never pulls a doctor (or firefighter, or warden) off their work to go put away items they scooped up earlier: interrupting someone rushing to tend a bleeding patient could get that patient killed. The side effect was that a doctor working through a queue of elective surgeries would carry those scooped items around the whole time, never dropping them off, even when walking right past their storage to fetch the operation's medicine.

  Now, while a doctor is doing an elective (non-emergency) surgery, it drops its scooped load off when (and only when) its storage is close to the path it is already walking. Typically this is the trip out to fetch the operation's medicine. By default this is about a 4-tile detour at most, so the surgery is barely delayed, and you can tune it or turn it off entirely with the new "Unload detour during important work" setting (under Unloading). A true emergency such as tending the wounded or fighting a fire is never interrupted at all, and rescue and warden work are still left completely alone. If the storage is not on the way, the doctor simply carries the load until it has a free moment, as it did previously.

## 1.16.11

### Patch Changes

- 4d0afc4: Fix ArgumentOutOfRangeException in self-pickup when stale entries are pruned below a valid one.

  TakeNextValidPending tracked the nearest valid pending drop by its list index (bestIndex), then pruned stale entries with RemoveAt(i) inside the same backward scan. Removing an entry below bestIndex shifted every entry above it down by one, so bestIndex silently drifted past the end of the now-shorter list — the post-loop pendingSelfPickups[bestIndex] threw ArgumentOutOfRangeException. This crashed every self-pickup toil init (harvesting, mining, area sweeps) whenever a stale entry sat below a valid one in the queue. Track the Thing reference instead of the index; Remove(thing) is immune to the shift.

## 1.16.10

### Patch Changes

- 803ef5b: Fix several bulk-loading bugs affecting transport pods and map portals when several colonists load them at once, or when a colonist's job gets redirected mid-load.

  The first bug caused a transport pod told to load a large quantity of something (say 300 steel) to end up overfilled and unable to launch, needing a manual reselect. Once several colonists had already claimed enough between them to cover the order, a further idle colonist could still fall back to vanilla's own loading logic, which has no idea HD's colonists were already carrying the rest of it over. That colonist would then haul in even more, past what was actually needed. Colonists no longer fall back to vanilla's loader while every remaining unit is already accounted for by others still mid-trip.

  The second bug showed up after forcing a colonist already loading one transport pod to load a different one instead (or, less directly, after any other job interruption mid-load): that colonist would keep hauling only one small stack per trip afterward, never using its full carry capacity again, until you cancelled the load order and re-issued it. Whatever it was still carrying from the interrupted load, but that the new destination didn't want at all, was quietly counted against its carry limit forever, since nothing else ever prompted it to put that leftover away. Planning a new load now looks past that leftover cargo instead of treating it as permanent dead weight.

  The third bug affected loading a shuttle on a temporary map (a raided camp, an event site): the first colonist to respond could claim the entire order for itself, leaving the rest to wander with nothing to do or fall back to slow one-stack-at-a-time hauling. On a temporary map, where everyone present is normally there specifically to load up and leave, colonists now divide a large order between each other the same way they already do when everyone is boarding the same shuttle.

  A fourth report, about the wrong specific xenogerm or genepack sometimes getting loaded when several near-identical ones are available, was investigated by decompiling the base game's item-matching. The base game's `TransferableUtility.TransferAsOne` does correctly distinguish genepacks/xenogerms by their gene sets (via `CanStackTogether`), so Hauler's Dream's own sweep already picks the right instance. The wrong loading instead surfaces in the vanilla fallback path: vanilla's `FindThingToLoad` collects all still-needed things from every manifest entry into one flat set and picks the closest, without checking at search time which specific entry the thing belongs to — and the fallback's deposit accounting (`TransferableMatchingDesperate`) has a def-only fallback tier that can credit the wrong entry. This sits upstream of anything Hauler's Dream controls, so no code change was made for it; the new fully-claimed guard added for the overfill bug also helps here by suppressing the vanilla fallback sooner.

  Additionally, the same fully-claimed guard was extended to the Vehicle Framework loading path for consistency, so vehicles benefit from the same overfill protection as transport pods and map portals.

## 1.16.9

### Patch Changes

- b92463b: Fix colonists crossing paths to pick up harvested/mined yields instead of taking whichever is closest to them.

  Each colonist queues its own dropped yields (and any nearby loose stacks it sweeps up along the way) into a private pickup list, but until now that list was popped from the wrong end: a colonist walked to the oldest queued drop first rather than the one nearest to where it actually stands right now. With several colonists working a big field at once, this could send the wrong colonist all the way across the field for a stack a much closer colonist had already queued for itself, since nothing coordinated between them.

  Two changes fix this together. First, a colonist now picks the nearest still-valid stack out of its own list rather than the oldest one. Second, colonists now share a lightweight registry of who currently has which stack queued: if a colonist claims a stack another colonist already has pending, and the new claimant is actually closer to it right now, the claim (and the walk) transfers to whoever is closer. This self-corrects as everyone keeps working, so the colony as a whole ends up sending the nearest available colonist to each stack instead of crossing paths.

## 1.16.8

### Patch Changes

- 473875f: Fix a much bigger cause of the same colonists-freezing-in-place bug (#160): giving a bulk-haul order while the game was paused could rebuild the whole sweep plan hundreds of times in a couple of real seconds for nothing.

  Bulk-haul orders remember their plan for the rest of the tick so opening a menu or clicking doesn't redo the same expensive search over and over, but that memory was deliberately skipped whenever the game was paused, to make sure queuing a second nearby order was noticed right away. The debug logs you sent showed exactly what that costs in practice: a single paused ordering session rebuilding the same plan for the same colonist several hundred times in a few seconds, worse with more colonists or orders queued at once. The fix keeps that memory turned on while paused too, but only reuses it as long as nothing about that colonist's current job or queue has actually changed since, so a genuinely new order still gets noticed immediately while a repeated click or hover no longer pays for a full rebuild.

- 473875f: Fix the real cause of colonists standing still for about ten seconds while harvesting or mining, worse with several colonists working the same area (#160).

  Both the self-pickup job (a colonist scooping its own dropped yields) and the bulk-haul sweep walk a whole list of ground stacks in one trip. In a busy area with several colonists moving around, a stack that was reachable when it got queued can become blocked by the time the colonist actually walks to it. Neither job handled that gracefully, so a single blocked stack ended the entire job, and vanilla's own response to that kind of failure is a hardcoded few-second wait that a freshly queued job cannot interrupt. With several colonists hitting this independently in the same field, the waits stacked up into the reported freeze. Both jobs now just skip a stack they can no longer reach and carry on with the rest of the list, the same way they already skip a stack that got stolen or forbidden.

  Also closed a smaller gap in the same area: a colonist's own dropped yields are queued for pickup without checking whether they can actually be reached, unlike every other picker in the mod. They're now checked the same way, so a permanently unreachable drop is left for normal hauling instead of being walked toward at all.

- 473875f: Fix the pickup pause and progress bar still showing up on "Haul everything nearby" and a shift-queued second "Prioritize hauling" order.

  The recent change that made automatic cleanup instant again missed two of the ways a colonist can end up sweeping several stacks into their pack: clicking "Haul everything nearby", and shift-queuing a second "Prioritize hauling" order near one already in progress (which takes over as one sweep). Both are the same kind of order as plain "Prioritize hauling" and should be just as instant, but they were still pausing on every stack because the code was telling them apart from a genuinely paced order using the wrong signal, one that every deliberate hauling order sets regardless of what kind it is. It now checks the one thing that actually means "pocket this into inventory and hold onto it", the same way vanilla's own delayed pickup does, so only "Pick up X" and "Keep X in inventory" pace, and both bulk-sweep orders are instant again like plain "Prioritize hauling" already was.

- 473875f: Fix colonists periodically freezing in place for several seconds while harvesting, mining, or deconstructing, especially with several of them working at once.

  Hauler's Dream re-checks whether a colonist should drop off its accumulated load on the way to its next job every time it picks up a new one. Once a colonist working through a field, a mineral vein, or a row of walls was carrying enough to make that check worth running, it reran a real storage search on every single plant, chunk, or wall in the run with nothing slowing it down, because that search only ever backed off after an actual drop-off, not after a "not worth it right now" answer. With several colonists doing this at the same time, the searches piled up and the game visibly stalled. The check now backs off for a little while after it runs regardless of the answer, so it can no longer be repeated on every single item in a run.

  While looking into this, the same gap issue #152 fixed on the end-of-run drop-off check turned up on two of its siblings, the "drop it off on the way" check and the opt-in "drop it off before a long walk while overloaded" check: both would consider a colonist a candidate to divert as long as it was carrying anything at all, even if none of it was actually surplus to store. Both now require some real surplus first, same as every other drop-off trigger.

## 1.16.7

### Patch Changes

- 16be099: Fix the Enter key closing the in-game report window instead of starting a new line in the description.

  Pressing Enter while writing a bug report (or a reply on the My Reports thread) closed the window rather than adding a line break, so you could not lay a report out across several lines. The window was catching Enter as its accept key before the text box could see it. It no longer does, so Enter starts a new line like any other text field; reports and replies are still sent with the Send button, and Escape still closes the window.

- 16be099: Fix pawns loading the wrong quality or variant of an item into a shuttle, transport pod, portal, or vehicle.

  When you set a shuttle to load a specific item, say a normal-quality jacket, a pawn could instead grab a different one of the same kind that happened to be nearer, like an excellent-quality jacket sitting right next to the shuttle, and load that. The bulk loader was matching items by their type alone, without confirming that the quality, material, and hit points matched what the manifest actually asked for. It now checks, the same way the base game does: a pawn only picks up an item that matches a requested entry, and only up to the count that entry still needs. Storage hauling, bill ingredients, and pack-animal loading were already doing the right thing and are unchanged.

## 1.16.6

### Patch Changes

- 7ebe671: Show "Batch: ..." on a bill's repeat-mode button when batch mode is on, so it is obvious at a glance.

  When you turn on batch mode for a bill, that choice only showed up inside the repeat-mode dropdown you had to open first. The button itself still read the plain "Do forever" (or "Do X times", or "Do until you have X"), so a bill that was quietly batching looked exactly like one that was not, and one player spent a couple of hours puzzled by a bill's behaviour before realising batch mode had been left on. The button now reads "Batch: Do forever" and so on whenever the bill is actually batching, using the same wording the dropdown already shows.

  This works with both the vanilla bills tab and Nice Bill Tab. With Nice Bill Tab installed the label shows on its own bill rows and in the shared details dialog as well; without it, nothing changes.

- 4460224: Stop a colonist from pacing forever instead of relaxing when the only thing they are carrying is something they keep on purpose.

  When a colonist finished its work while still carrying hauled goods, Hauler's Dream would send it to put the load away before wandering off to relax. The check for "is there anything to put away" only asked whether a carried stack was in the pack and free to grab, not whether any of it was actually surplus. So if the last thing a colonist was carrying was personal stock it deliberately keeps (its own food, drugs, a loadout item), the put-away trip found nothing to do, ended, and started again a moment later, over and over. The colonist paced in place and never settled into leisure. The end-of-work put-away now uses the same "is there real surplus to store" test as the actual unload and the carry-weight alert, so a colonist holding only keep-stock just heads off to relax and hangs on to it until real surplus turns up.

- 4460224: Sweeping loose items into a colonist's pack no longer takes longer than plain vanilla hauling.

  The pickup delay (the short pause and progress bar a colonist shows while pocketing a stack) used to apply to everything a colonist scooped up, including the automatic sweeps. So clearing a removed floor, a mined-out room, or any big pile of small stacks meant a couple of seconds spent on every single "2 wood" stack, when in vanilla the same debris would be swept up instantly.

  The delay now matches what vanilla actually does: only the deliberate "Pick up X" and "Keep X in inventory" orders are paced (exactly like vanilla's own pickup delay), while automatic hauling, scooping up your own work yields, and loading are instant again. Two new options under the pickup delay let you opt those automatic cases back in if you liked the old feel, one for automatic hauling and cleanup and one for loading transporters and pack animals. Both are off by default, so out of the box cleanup is as fast as vanilla.

## 1.16.5

### Patch Changes

- 3bdfb68: New optional cooking setting: cook with the ingredient you have the most of first.

  When you keep several kinds of food around, cooks normally grab whatever is closest, which can chew through the last of a scarce ingredient while a freezer full of something else sits untouched. Turn this on and cooks will reach for the food the colony has the most of first, so surplus gets used up and the things you are short on are left alone, with no need to forbid anything by hand. It only changes which already-allowed ingredient a cook picks up; it never touches the recipe, how far they look, or what a bill will accept, and it only applies to cooking, not to crafting with cloth, leather, steel and the like. If you also run "cook with the most-spoiled food first," this one wins, so a big frozen surplus gets eaten before scarce fresh food. Off by default.

- 15e3616: Keep colonists moving when a shared storage tile fills up mid haul, instead of dropping the load and pacing.

  Haul To Stack lets several colonists pile onto the same storage tile, but the game itself was not built for that: if the tile fills while a colonist is still walking over to it, the game cancels the whole haul and drops the item at their feet, and they pick it up and try again, over and over. Hauler's Dream now steps in the moment that happens and redirects the colonist, still carrying the item, to another stacking tile, so the haul just finishes. Nothing is dropped, nothing is reserved, and stacking stays fully on. If a colonist has to redirect many times in a row because storage is genuinely full, it still falls back to the existing brief pause as a safety net.

## 1.16.4

### Patch Changes

- b933134: Fix colonists still looping while carrying a hemogen pack (or another stackable item) toward storage in a prison or hospital, pacing back and forth without ever dropping it off even when storage is free.

  The earlier fix only bounded the loop when a hauler kept failing to place an item after reaching a storage cell. This one is different: the destination cell keeps going invalid while the hauler is still walking to the pack or carrying it, so the job fails and drops the pack before the hauler ever arrives, and the work scan starts an identical job right away. Hauler's Dream now also watches for a stackable item whose storage hauls keep failing in quick succession and, after a few, stops offering it to the automatic haul scan for a short while so the pointless pacing ends. It sorts itself out once storage settles, and a manual haul order always works immediately.

## 1.16.3

### Patch Changes

- 1b00ee1: Fix the Ingredient Threshold mod's repeat-mode option disappearing from bills when Hauler's Dream is installed.

  Hauler's Dream rebuilds the bill repeat-mode dropdown to add its batch modes, and Ingredient Threshold rebuilds the same dropdown to add its own "ingredient threshold" mode. Only one of those rebuilds can take effect, so depending on mod load order one mod's rebuild replaced the other's and its modes went missing, which is why the Ingredient Threshold option could not be selected after installing Hauler's Dream. Hauler's Dream now re-adds Ingredient Threshold's mode to its own dropdown and ensures its rebuild is the one that runs, so both mods' modes are available together. This is the same approach Hauler's Dream already uses to keep Everybody Gets One and Compositable Loadouts modes visible.

## 1.16.2

### Patch Changes

- 94e3212: Fix two issues reported from a large modded save: pawns over hauling into a small high priority stockpile, and the settings search dropping the framerate while typing.

  Bulk hauling now shares one storage budget per destination stockpile or shelf group across every item type bound for it, instead of letting each type price that group's free space on its own. Before, a pawn moving food up to a small stockpile could pocket the meat and the harvest as if each had the whole stockpile to itself, drop only what fit, then carry the rest back to where it came from. A group's empty cells are now spent once for the whole trip, so a pawn takes only what the destination can actually hold and leaves the rest at the source for the next haul cycle. Hauling a single item type was already handled correctly and is unchanged.

  The settings search now shows the top matches (up to 30) with a note when more exist, instead of drawing every match every frame. A short or broad query, including the prefixes you pass through while typing a longer word, could match most of the settings and redraw all of them each frame, which dropped the framerate whenever the search box had text in it. Refining the query narrows the list to reach the rest.

- 94e3212: Make in-game issue reporting work for players whose system blocks the report connection, and fix the report dialog's clipped error message.

  Some players' reports failed with "Unknown Error" because their Unity/Mono TLS stack could not validate the report server's (valid) certificate. Every report request now accepts the certificate for Hauler's Dream's own first-party report endpoint, which restores reporting for those players. This does drop chain validation on those specific requests, so it is worth being clear about what they carry: the tail of your Player.log (which can include local file paths and your OS username), your SteamID64 and Steam persona name, your active mod list, the per-install token that scopes reads to your own reports, and any log or screenshot you chose to attach. The decision still stands because these requests go only to Hauler's Dream's own endpoint, the alternative leaves affected players unable to report at all, and certificate pinning would break on the report host's routine certificate rotation. The handler is scoped to the report requests only, never a global override, so nothing else in the game is affected.

  When the connection still fails (for example a firewall or antivirus blocking RimWorld), the error message now says so, in all 15 languages, and the dialog's status area is measured from the actual message so even a long or wrapped translation is no longer clipped to a sliver of red. Also silences two startup warnings about texture-holding classes missing the StaticConstructorOnStartup attribute, which makes the "Remember plan" toggle icon load reliably instead of ever falling back to a magenta placeholder.

- 94e3212: Fix the per-pawn "Unload inventory" button setting reading as "Hide" in every translation, and stop the button from sitting among a pawn's ability gizmos.

  The checkbox that controls the per-pawn "Unload inventory" button turns the button on when it is checked, but every translated language still labelled it "Hide the ... button" (only the English text had been updated to say "Show"). All languages now read "Show", matching what the toggle actually does.

  The "Unload inventory" and per-pawn auto-haul buttons now declare a deliberate position instead of falling into the unordered default group. Left unset, they shared that group with the pawn's role and ability commands, and with a gizmo-reordering mod the unload button could end up wedged between abilities like a leader's speech and accusation. They now sit together in their own slot below the ability gizmos.

## 1.16.1

### Patch Changes

- ce0d1e7: Include the full origin stack in the breadcrumb Hauler's Dream logs when an exception passes through a method it patches.

  When an error passes through a patched method, Hauler's Dream re-throws it unchanged, which restamps the stack trace at the re-throw point, so the game's own report of that error names the re-throw site instead of the real source. The breadcrumb now captures the true stack the first time each patched method surfaces a given error, once per distinct error type per method so a repeating error does not flood the log. A report where Hauler's Dream only patched the method now shows exactly where the fault actually came from, instead of looking like Hauler's Dream caused it.

## 1.16.0

### Minor Changes

- 96c2cd7: Picking items up now takes a moment, with vanilla's pickup progress bar.

  Pawns used to vacuum stacks into their inventory instantly, which felt off next to the visible work delay vanilla shows when you order a pawn to pick something up. Now every Hauler's Dream pickup into inventory pauses at the stack with the familiar progress bar first: bulk hauling sweeps, picking things up along the way, scooping up mining and harvest yields, the "Pick up X" and "Keep X in inventory" orders, and the part of bulk loading and bulk refueling where pawns gather stacks off the ground. The default is 120 ticks per stack (about 2 seconds), which is exactly the delay vanilla itself uses for its pick up order, so an ordered pickup feels identical to vanilla and bulk work reads as deliberate effort instead of teleportation.

  A new "Pickup delay per stack" slider in the Hauling settings controls it. Slide it to 0 for the old instant pickups, leave it at 120 for the vanilla feel, or pick your own pace. Gathering ingredients for crafting and construction is deliberately not delayed, since vanilla grabs work materials instantly too, and unloading keeps its own separate pacing setting.

- 3a265fd: Temporary quest pawns drop what they picked up when they leave your control.

  Pawns lent to you during quests (lodgers, refugees, helpers from other factions) used to walk away with whatever ended up in their inventory: meals they grabbed, medicine, anything they pocketed while working for you. The moment such a pawn reverts to its own faction (the quest ends, they betray you, or they get arrested), it now drops everything it picked up while with the colony right where it stands, so your colonists can haul it back. It keeps only what it arrived with, plus its equipped weapons and worn apparel, which stay untouched. A pawn that leaves while inside one of your caravans already hands its load to the other caravan members, so nothing is lost there either.

  On by default; you can turn it off under Advanced, Safety net.

### Patch Changes

- a54a1bc: Fixed pawns standing at a construction site doing nothing forever under Combat Extended (issue #125, "can't make buildings with textile"), and fixed builders walking to a shelf for material they already carry (the Steam "build from inventory sometimes just doesn't work" report).

  The stand-in-place case was a re-offer livelock: the inventory construction delivery planned its load with mass math only, while the delivery driver's pickup is clamped by Combat Extended's bulk. A pawn whose remaining bulk fits zero units of the material (loadout-full pawns, and textiles from mods without a CE patch default to Bulk 1.0 per unit) got a job it could never load, completed it with zero progress the same tick, and was offered the identical job again, forever. Right clicking converted the same way and died the same way. The reporter's log retains 2251 repeats of the identical delivery line across two pawns and two sessions. The planner now checks the same per material bulk fit the driver uses, declines the conversion whenever one bulk capped inventory trip cannot beat a plain hand carry (hands are not bulk limited in CE), and clamps the gather and the load plan by that fit otherwise. Bulk blocked pawns fall back to vanilla hand delivery and actually build.

  The shelf detour case: the planner only consulted a pawn's inventory when the whole map had no floor stock of the material, so a builder carrying enough for the ordered wall still fetched from the nearest shelf first. Deliveries (ordered and automatic) are now served straight from the builder's own carried stock whenever it covers at least one full delivery chunk, the lesser of the site's remaining need and one hand load. That also lets a Combat Extended pawn whose bulk is full of the very material it should deliver unload it into the build instead of livelocking. This honors the "Build from inventory (use already-carried materials)" setting: with it off, own carried stock is never spent this way, and bulk blocked pawns still fall back to the working vanilla hand delivery.

- f23e23e: Fixed designated chunks being hauled one at a time under Combat Extended even with Bulk hauling set to Always (issue #124). The Combat Extended guard from the one round at a time ammo fix compared how many units fit in inventory (capped by the stack's live count) against a def level hand armful. With a chunk stacking mod raising the chunk stack limit above one, every lone field chunk (always a 1 count stack) compared 1 against that armful and wrongly declined the automatic bulk sweep, so vanilla hand hauled one chunk per trip. The hands side is now clamped by the stack's live count: a stack that fits whole in inventory is never declined, because hands cannot move more than the whole stack either. Bulky ammo in big shelf stacks still declines exactly as before, keeping the one round at a time fix intact. The explicit haul everything nearby order was unaffected and still sweeps.
- 019396d: Stop the infinite haul loop on freshly extracted hemogen packs (and any other storage haul that keeps failing to place).

  Reported with a clean save: after extracting hemogen packs from prisoners, haulers paced the barracks corridor forever, "hauling hemogen pack" in hand, never depositing, until a manual prioritize order replaced the stuck job. The cause is that vanilla's storage haul retries without any bound inside one job: every failed drop re-resolves storage from wherever the pawn now stands, retargets the same job and walks again, and with no storage resolving it retargets to a bare ground spot and walks again all the same. Because Hauler's Dream intentionally lets several haulers deliver to the same tile (the haul to stack feature skips vanilla's destination cell reservation), two haulers can converge on the same few viable cells and invalidate each other's arrivals indefinitely, so that retry cycle never ends.

  Storage hauls now carry a small retry budget: a job that fails to place its load several times in a row (without delivering a single unit in between) is ended, the carried stack is set down at the pawn's feet like any failed haul, and that item is left alone by the automatic haul scan for a few seconds so the identical doomed job is not rebuilt instantly. The same short pause follows a haul that found no storage anywhere and had to set its load down on open ground, so the next storage attempt is not rebuilt on the spot against unchanged storage. Everything self heals: once the backoff passes the item is hauled normally, and an explicit player order always works immediately. Healthy hauls stay far from the budget: a legitimate re-route resolves in one or two retries, topping up a near full stack counts as progress rather than failure (each partial delivery resets the budget), and multi item unload trips reset it on every delivered item.

- b71ce2d: Colonists ordered to leave an underground map with loot now share the gathering instead of one pawn claiming everything while the rest wander.

  When several colonists were sent through an exit portal (a pit gate or cave exit) together with loot, the first pawn to plan its load claimed the whole manifest up to its smart overload ceiling, which routinely covers an entire dungeon haul. The other ordered pawns then found nothing left to claim, and the board gate held them back from entering while goods remained, so they idled and wandered until the one loaded pawn finished. Bulk load plans are now clamped to an even mass share of the claimable loot across every ready co loader (the pawns ordered to board that portal or transporter group), with a floor so every share stays big enough to hold any single remaining item (a heavy sculpture never becomes unclaimable just because the even split runs smaller than it). A lone loader, a player ordered load, and vehicle loading keep their full plan exactly as before.

  A pawn that has nothing left to claim (every remaining item is another loader's in flight slice) now boards the portal instead of pacing next to it, matching how the base game behaves. The pawns still gathering finish the manifest.

  Also fixes a silent failure where bulk portal loading at overload level "Free" (level 0) built empty plans: the unlimited trip budget overflowed an integer conversion and every stack read as unaffordable, so those pawns quietly fell back to loading one stack at a time.

- 89150ec: Stop pawns from reading books nonstop until they starve to death when another mod (or stale item state) breaks a job check Hauler's Dream participates in.

  When a thinking step raises an error, RimWorld logs it once (an entry that is easy to miss among repeats) and skips that step, and a pawn absorbed in a book only rechecks its urgent needs every few hundred ticks. Hauler's Dream adds logic to several of those thinking steps (put the load away before eating or sleeping, eat a meal a colonist is carrying, shed cargo before a mech charges), and that logic touches many other mods' items and compatibility hooks. If any of that raised an error, the whole food check failed every single time, while the recreation check kept handing the pawn its book: the pawn read nonstop, refused every other task, and eventually starved (issue 122). The same failure on the charge check could drain a mech to forced shutdown.

  Hauler's Dream's additions to the food, rest, joy, work, unload, and mech charge checks now contain their own failures: the problem is reported once in the log (with the stack trace pointing at the actual culprit), and the vanilla decision stands, so the pawn still eats, sleeps, works, and charges no matter what failed inside the enhancement. The carried-meal search also skips items that are not actually edible instead of tripping over them. A new build guard keeps these boundaries from regressing.

## 1.15.5

### Patch Changes

- 20db899: Under Combat Extended, leave a mechanoid's carry weight to Combat Extended by default again.

  The "Mechanoid carrying capacity" setting says it has no effect while Combat Extended is installed, and that is what every language's description promised. An earlier change made Hauler's Dream override a work mech's Combat Extended carry weight anyway, even at the default ×1.0, which contradicted that description and took the mech's encumbrance away from Combat Extended.

  That override is now opt-in. At the default ×1.0 the setting stays out of the way and Combat Extended manages the mech's carry weight, as described. Raising the slider above ×1.0 turns the override back on, setting the mech's Combat Extended carry weight to its carrying capacity times the multiplier, for players who want their work mechs to haul by their carrying capacity under Combat Extended. Games without Combat Extended, and pawns other than your own mechs, are unchanged.

## 1.15.4

### Patch Changes

- d2b6599: Stop over-hauling into a nearly-full storage, and stop delivering bulky Combat Extended ammo one round at a time.

  When a high-priority storage had only a little room left and the same items sat in a lower-priority storage, pawns would each pocket a whole stack, drop the two or three that fit, and carry the rest right back. Hauls that move an item already in valid storage into a better one are now capped to what the destination can actually take, so no excess gets carried out and back. Loose items on the ground are untouched by this and still get swept in full as before.

  With Combat Extended, hauling very bulky ammo (like heavy cannon shells) into a shelf could crawl one round per trip. Combat Extended limits how much fits in a pawn's inventory by bulk, but not what it carries in its hands, so routing such a stack through inventory delivered less per trip than a plain haul. Hauler's Dream now leaves those hauls to the normal hands carry, which moves a full armful in one trip. Light ammo and normal goods are unaffected, and the explicit "haul everything nearby" order still sweeps.

## 1.15.3

### Patch Changes

- b6c16d0: "Pick up X" and "Keep X in inventory" now work on corpses.

  A fresh kill left on the ground, like a small dead rabbit, could not be pocketed: right-clicking it offered neither "Pick up" nor "Keep in inventory", so the only options were to walk it to storage right away or leave it for predators to eat. Both orders now appear on corpses too. "Pick up" carries the body in the pawn's inventory and the normal unload trip delivers it to a corpse stockpile or grave later, so a hunter can bag the kill and keep working. A corpse too heavy to pocket falls back to a regular hand haul, exactly like an oversized stack.

  Auto-strip on haul behaves the same on this path as on a normal corpse haul: with "every haul" selected the body is stripped when picked up, and the gear rides along in the same pawn's inventory. "Keep in inventory" holds the corpse whole and never strips it.

- b6c16d0: Close three more gaps around the "Pick up X" and "Keep X in inventory" orders.

  "Keep X in inventory" now works on items stored inside container buildings, like the egg box or a storage mod's containers. Those items showed no right-click option at all before, even though the same items on a shelf could be kept. The pawn walks to the container and takes the item straight out of it.

  When several different things lie under the cursor, each one now gets its own "Pick up" and "Keep" entry instead of only the first. That matches how the game lists one "Prioritize hauling" per thing.

  "Haul everything nearby" ordered on a corpse headed for a grave used to quietly downgrade to a single hand haul with no sweep. It now pockets the corpse and sweeps the surroundings like the order promises, and the unload delivers the body to the grave.

## 1.15.2

### Patch Changes

- 4507253: Only show the "Plan prioritized removing floor" right-click option when the floor is already marked for removal.

  The option used to appear over any floor you right-clicked, which cluttered the menu when you just wanted to haul or clean. Now it shows up only on a floor you have already marked with the vanilla Remove Floor order, and the planned route covers those marked floors instead of designating extra ones. Mark the floors you want gone first, then right-click one to plan a prioritized route.

- 4507253: Fix the settings selector showing "Custom (unsaved)" on a default configuration.

  Since the route-planner update, the profile selector at the top of the settings window always read "Custom (unsaved)", even on a brand-new install and even right after choosing "Default (profile, built-in)". Two of the remembered-route stores (the sow and remove-floor route templates) were left out of the code that compares the live settings against the defaults, so the comparison always saw a difference that was not really there. That same gap would also make "Create new profile" fail and "Copy profile" produce a broken code. All of those now work: a default or freshly reset configuration reads "Default" again, creating and copying profiles works, and pasted profile codes carry your remembered sow and remove-floor routes.

  There is also a self-check at startup and a build check so this whole class of problem is caught early if a future setting is added without wiring it into the profile system.

## 1.15.1

### Patch Changes

- 6089d66: Stop hauling from getting in the way of doctoring, rescue, and firefighting.

  Two bugs made colonists neglect urgent medical and emergency work while they were carrying items for Hauler's Dream. First, a pawn holding scooped goods that was about to tend a wounded pawn, rescue a downed one, or fight a fire could be sent to drop its load at storage first, so after a fight nobody tended the bleeding and rescues basically never happened, even with those jobs on priority 1. Hauler's Dream now never diverts a pawn away from doctoring, rescue, or firefighting to unload. Ordinary work like hauling, mining, and cleaning still drops off a load on the way, exactly as before.

  Second, a colonist waiting in bed for treatment could be pulled upright over and over: it would go fetch a meal from another colonist's inventory, or be told to unload, and then the game would send it back to bed, so it kept standing up and lying down (reproducible with an anesthesia operation on a patient set to no medicine). Hauler's Dream now leaves a colonist that should be resting for medical care in its bed. A doctor still brings that patient a carried meal, and the "unload now" button still works.

  Also hardened the settings dirty-check so a fresh default configuration is not mislabeled as "Custom (unsaved)" because of harmless differences from saving and reloading the config.

## 1.15.0

### Minor Changes

- 908c58a: Keep the tools your pawns carry when you use Grab Your Tool.

  If you run Grab Your Tool, often alongside a tool mod like Tools O' Plenty, so colonists carry pickaxes, hammers, sickles, and other work tools in their inventory, Hauler's Dream now leaves those tools alone instead of shipping them off to storage. Before, it could treat a carried tool as spare inventory and haul it away, and Grab Your Tool would just fetch it back, so a pawn kept picking the same tool up again. Now a colonist's carried tools stay put.

  This turns on by itself when Grab Your Tool is installed. Tools carried as Simple Sidearms were already handled, so between the two, tool mods that lean on either carrier are covered. If you would rather a specific tool go to storage anyway, set an "Unload always" rule for it in the individual item unload settings and that still wins.

### Patch Changes

- 908c58a: Add an in-game mod icon and a load-order hint for auto-sorters.

  Hauler's Dream now ships a mod icon (the "HD" logo), so it shows its own icon in the in-game mod list and in mod managers instead of a blank placeholder. It also tells auto-sorters (RimSort, RimPy, Mod Manager) to load after Combat Extended when both are installed, since that is the one framework it shares a patched game method with. Hauler's Dream is otherwise load-order independent, so no manual sorting is needed; the biggest thing you can do for it is to remove the older hauling mods it replaces (like Pick Up And Haul), which its Migration tab can turn off for you in one click.

## 1.14.0

### Minor Changes

- ce98d8a: Keep an item in a pawn's inventory without hauling it off.

  Right-clicking a haulable item on the ground now offers "Keep X in inventory" next to the existing "Pick up X". The difference is what happens after: "Pick up X" grabs the item to haul it away to storage, while "Keep X in inventory" makes the pawn take it and hold onto it. Hauler's Dream never hauls a kept item to storage, and the game's routine "drop unused inventory" cleanup leaves it alone, so a colonist can carry a spare weapon, a doctor can keep a stack of medicine on hand, or a hauler can hold something you want moved by hand later. To let go of a kept item, have the pawn use it up or drop it from the Gear tab. A "Keep in inventory" order can be turned off in the mod options if you only want the haul version. (#103)

- ce98d8a: See the status of your reports right on the main menu.

  When you file an in-game report, or the developer replies to one, marks it solved, or ships a fix in an update, a small card appears in the bottom-right of the main menu. Each of your reports gets a single card that updates as things happen, for example from open to a new comment, so there is never a pile-up. The card is colour-coded so you can read it at a glance: green for open, yellow for a new comment, and purple for resolved. Click it to read the reply or comment back without leaving the game, or press the x to hide it until there is new activity. It only shows reports you submitted, so a fresh game with no reports shows nothing.

  A "Main menu notifications" setting on the Advanced tab lets you choose how much shows up, from every event (including the confirmation that a report is open) down to only fixes, with a heads-up when a newer version is available, or turn it off entirely.

- ce98d8a: Plan a route over more than one kind of target.

  The route planner can now gather several types of target in one run. Next to the existing forced-target picker there is an "Add target type…" button: click it, then click another plant, ore, or other same-work target on the map, and the route includes every one of that kind too. So a colonist can harvest a field of berries and a field of rice on the same trip, or mine steel and components together, instead of planning each type on its own. It works for the def-based jobs (harvesting, cutting, mining); the primary target you right-clicked is always kept and each added type can be removed again. (#96)

- ce98d8a: Plan a route to remove floors.

  Right-clicking a tile that has a removable floor now offers "Plan prioritized removing floor…", the same way the planner already works for harvesting or mining. Pick the whole connected patch of floor, the nearest few tiles, or a radius, and a colonist strips the flooring in one efficient trip rather than you shift-clicking every tile by hand. It is handy for clearing the floors out of ruins to keep colony wealth down, especially when they sit at the edge of the map. (#96)

- ce98d8a: Remember a route you like, and run it again in one click.

  Open the planner on any kind of target, set it up the way you want, then press the new "Remember these settings" button at the bottom of the window. That saves the plan for that specific type of target: berry bushes, walls, a stone floor, whatever you clicked. The button then reads "Already remembered" until you change a setting, so you can tell at a glance that what is on screen is the saved plan. From then on its right-click menu reads "Plan prioritized … (remembered)" and choosing it runs that saved plan straight away, skipping the planner window. A plain click replaces the current job and Shift-clicking appends to the queue, the same as any other prioritized order.

  Only a type you have actually remembered shows the "(remembered)" option. Everything else keeps opening the planner as before, so the shortcut never fires a plan you did not set up. Pressing Remember again on the same type overwrites what was saved for it. This is separate from the settings the planner already restores each time you reopen it for a type; those still come back as they did, but they are not what the one-click runs.

  The "Remember plan" toggle in the bottom-right corner is the master switch. Turn it off to pause every one-click remembered route without losing what you saved, and turn it back on to use them again. Hovering the Remember button blinks that toggle and points an arrow at it, so you can see they belong together. Harvesting and mining routes are remembered per target type, sowing is remembered per plant, and floor removal is remembered per floor type.

### Patch Changes

- ce98d8a: Be clearer about which errors are actually Hauler's Dream, and fix a Vehicle Framework warning.

  When an error passes through a method Hauler's Dream patches, its note in the log now says plainly whether Hauler's Dream's own code was in the error or whether it only happens to patch that method. A report about a "value does not fall within the expected range" error (#97) is the second kind: the fault is in the game's own drop-unused-inventory check reading a drug that a mod adds but that isn't in the pawn's drug policy, and Hauler's Dream is only a bystander in the call stack. The note now reflects that instead of implying Hauler's Dream caused it.

  Separately, with Vehicle Framework installed, Hauler's Dream could log a harmless "could not attach the exception tagger" warning: it was trying to tag a method Vehicle Framework inherits from a shared generic base, which Harmony won't patch in that form. It now tags the method that actually runs, so the warning is gone and the vehicle-loading behaviour is unchanged.

## 1.13.0

### Minor Changes

- 3276639: Fishing catches are now collected like any other work result.

  With the Odyssey expansion, a pawn that finishes fishing carries its catch out to storage on its own, the same way it already does for harvested crops, mined ore, and salvage, instead of leaving the fish on the bank for a separate hauling trip. A new "Fishing (catch)" row on the Work & yields settings tab controls it: drop and collect, collect straight to inventory, or leave it on the ground for a normal hauler. The row only shows when Odyssey is active. Catches from fishing mods that build on the base game's fishing, such as Vanilla Fishing Expanded or Medieval Overhaul, are covered too, because they produce the catch through the same fishing job. An animal fishing to feed itself keeps its meal.

- 3276639: Set item unload rules for a whole category at once.

  The Individual Item Unload Settings window can now apply a rule to an entire category in one action instead of going item by item. Each category shows the rule its items share ("Default", "Never unload", "Keep at most", "Always unload", or "Mixed" when they differ), and clicking it sets the whole category at once. That turns setting up a large group like a combat mod's many ammo types into a single click. The list also covers every item in the game and your installed mods, organised by category the way a workbench's bill filter is.

### Patch Changes

- 3276639: Show Compositable Loadouts' bill mode again.

  If you run Compositable Loadouts, its extra repeat mode ("X per Tag", make one of something per colonist assigned a loadout tag) went missing from the bill's repeat dropdown while Hauler's Dream was installed. Hauler's Dream rebuilds that dropdown to add its batch options, and in doing so it was leaving out modes that other mods add. It now puts Compositable Loadouts' mode back, the same way it already does for Everybody Gets One.

## 1.12.1

### Patch Changes

- a34cdeb: Arriving pawns now put hauled cargo into proper storage instead of the nearest pile.

  When a pawn arrived somewhere with a full inventory (returning from a caravan, dropping in by pod or transporter, or teleported home by a psycast), the game's "unload everything" routine dropped its cargo into the closest storage it could find, ignoring your storage filters and priorities. Hauler's Dream was meant to step in there and route the cargo it had been hauling to proper storage instead, but a long-standing mix-up of two similarly named jobs meant that step never actually ran. It runs now, so cargo a pawn was carrying for Hauler's Dream lands where you'd want it on arrival, the same as a normal haul trip.

  This only takes over on maps where there is somewhere to put the cargo (your home base, or an away map you've set up storage on). On a bare map with no storage, the cargo keeps riding home in the pawn's inventory exactly as before, so a pawn arriving on, say, an escape-ship visit just goes about its business instead of getting stuck retrying an unload it can't finish.

- a34cdeb: Fix a red error when one worker finishes a build another was hauling materials to.

  When several mechs or pawns built a large structure together (a substructure floor, for example), one of them could throw an error and drop its task if a different worker finished the exact piece it was still carrying materials toward. Hauler's Dream was asking the build site how much more it needed at the instant that site was completed and removed, which the game cannot answer about something that no longer exists. It now confirms the site is still there first and quietly moves on when it is gone, so the worker just picks its next job with no error and nothing carried is lost.

- a34cdeb: Fix scooped crops sometimes not loading onto a caravan, transporter, portal, or vehicle.

  When a pawn scooped a harvest that merged into a stack it was already carrying, the bulk loader could decide it had nothing left to load and finish early, leaving that merged stack behind to go to storage instead of onto the carrier. The loader's "is there anything to load" check was reading an outdated list of carried stacks, while the actual loading step read the corrected one, so a stack that had merged after being picked up fell through the gap. The check now reads the same corrected list the loading step uses, so a merged stack is recognized and loaded. This is the loading-side cousin of the dropped-crops bug, on the same merge trigger.

- a34cdeb: Stop pawns from dropping scooped crops on the ground again.

  Harvested crops, milk, eggs and other raw food a pawn had picked up to haul would sometimes get dumped back at its feet instead of carried to storage. It came back recently with psychoid leaves. The cause is a vanilla routine that clears raw food out of a colonist's inventory after a couple of in-game days, and on established saves it could slip past the old guard when a scooped stack had merged with another one. Now, while a pawn is carrying raw food it picked up, that vanilla routine is held off entirely, and the per-item guard reads the corrected list of carried stacks so a merged stack is no longer missed. So this does not quietly return in a future update, the mod also checks at startup that the protection is actually in place and reports loudly if it is not, the build fails if any layer of the guard is weakened, and a test pins the exact vanilla rule it relies on.

- a34cdeb: Stop pawns from unloading one stack at a time while working at full capacity.

  When a pawn had no room to build up a load (for example under Combat Extended, or when the carry limit is set below a pawn's full capacity), every single thing it scooped while working sent it off to unload a single stack at storage and come straight back for the next one. Harvesting a rice field turned into a constant back and forth, one stack per trip. The "I'm full, unload now" trigger now waits the same short cooldown between trips that the mod's other unload triggers already use, so the pawn gathers a worthwhile load and makes one trip instead of many.

## 1.12.0

### Minor Changes

- edecf55: Per-category control over collecting work results.

  Each kind of work result now has its own behavior: leave it on the ground (Off), drop then haul it, or take it straight into the working pawn's inventory. The old global "pick-up handling" switch and the on/off work-type checkboxes are replaced by one list under "Collect work results" in the Work & yields tab.

  Mining is split into ore/resources and chunks, and plant work is split into harvest (crops & berries) and logging (trees & cacti), so you can, for example, send ore straight to inventory while leaving heavy chunks on the ground. Existing settings migrate automatically: anything that was on keeps its old drop-or-direct behavior, anything that was off becomes Off, and the split categories inherit their old combined setting.

- edecf55: Search box for the settings.

  There's now a search field above the tab list. Type part of an option's name, its description, or its category and the tabs step aside to show just the matching settings. It's a best-match search, so a small typo or a couple of words in the wrong order still finds the right thing; closer matches sort to the top.

  The results aren't a read-only list: each match is the real control, fully editable right there in the search panel. Matches stay grouped under their section heading (with the tab's icon next to it), and clicking a heading jumps to that tab and briefly highlights the option so you can see where it lives.

- edecf55: Clearer "Work & yields" tab.

  The three choices for each work result are renamed so they read as one idea instead of two unrelated destinations: Leave on ground / Drop, then collect / Collect directly. Both "collect" options end up in the working pawn's own inventory and get put away on the next unload trip; the only difference is whether the result drops on the floor first (which lets another hauler grab it). The help text spells that out.

  The nine categories are now a compact table with the three choices shown once as column headers and a radio per cell, instead of the same three-button strip repeated on every row.

  "Keep working when full" and "Tidy up while working" moved onto this tab, next to the yields they govern; "Top up existing stacks" moved to the Unloading tab.

### Patch Changes

- d87bfb8: Stop colonists from instantly dropping a picked-up drug.

  When a pawn picked a smokeleaf joint (or any drug) into its inventory, via the "Pick up X" order or an on-the-way grab, it would drop it again the moment it looked for its next job, leaving it on the ground. Vanilla drops any inventory drug a colonist isn't scheduled or addicted to keep, and that sweep wasn't recognising a drug Hauler's Dream was carrying to storage. A drug Hauler's Dream has picked up now stays in the pack until the unload trip puts it away, the same as every other haulable. Non-drug items were never affected.

- edecf55: Clearer settings throughout.

  A full pass over the settings to make options understandable at a glance: plain-language labels in place of internal terms (no more "scoop", "consumer-aware", "en-route", "accumulate window", "ticks"), one consistent name per feature, and help text that says what each option does and what its default is. Fixed cross-references that pointed at the wrong control name.

  Notable: the work-result options now read "Leave on ground / Drop & haul / To inventory" with a short "why pick this" for each; "How long a pawn keeps collecting before a trip" (formerly "Accumulate window") is shown in hours and moved to the Unloading page; the "Routing & storage" page is now "On-the-way hauling"; and timing readouts show seconds/hours instead of raw ticks. No behavior changes.

- edecf55: Translations filled in across all 14 languages.

  The per-category work-result options, the settings search box, and a backlog of other recently added strings were still showing English in the translated games. They are now translated in Simplified Chinese, Danish, Dutch, French, German, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Polish, Brazilian Portuguese, Russian, Spanish, Thai, and Ukrainian. Proper names like "Hauler's Dream" stay as-is.

## 1.11.1

### Patch Changes

- d9e6130: Fix a periodic stutter and a false log-writer error.

  - **Periodic hitch with a shelf + items in inventory (issue #76):** the "cannot unload" alert re-evaluated about once a second and, for a single-pawn colony with the pawn outside the home area carrying tagged surplus, triggered a vanilla NullReferenceException inside `StoreUtility.TryFindStoreCellNearColonyDesperate` (its "spot just outside the colony" search). Catching that exception every recompute was the stutter the dev console deduped, so it looked error-free. Hauler's Dream now uses a safe, non-throwing home-area cell check for this probe instead of the fragile vanilla call. Normal colonies are unaffected.
  - **False "disk debug log writer stopped after an I/O error" on quit/restart:** the background log writer was reporting the normal shutdown `ThreadAbortException` as a disk I/O fault. It now recognises the benign teardown signal and stays quiet; genuine I/O faults are still surfaced.

## 1.11.0

### Minor Changes

- fb04e90: feat: shuttle/transporter passengers now bulk-load the very transport they're about to board.

  Previously the pawns you selected to ride a shuttle (or load + board a transporter) did vanilla one-stack-at-a-time loading, because Hauler's Dream stands its bulk-load down for any pawn directed by a Lord (which a boarding passenger is). Bulk loading only happened if a separate, non-boarding hauler was free. Now a boarding passenger is allowed to bulk-load the exact transport it's assigned to board: it sweeps its share of the cargo in one trip, deposits it, then boards. The carve-out is tight, only the pawn's own shuttle/portal, so ritual, caravan, and quest inventories stay protected.

  If such a passenger is interrupted mid-load (it gets hungry, drafted, has a mental break) while carrying gathered cargo, it now deposits that cargo into the transport on its next step instead of carrying it off, so loading can't get stuck.

### Patch Changes

- fb04e90: fix: shuttle/transporter pawns stuck "waiting" after loading, and psychic-ritual target being emptied.

  Shuttle and transporter loading: after the cargo was fully loaded, the colonists assigned to board would keep "waiting" and had to be forced in. Hauler's Dream's board gate kept blocking based on its own internal loading bookkeeping, which could linger a moment after the goods were already aboard. The gate now lets a pawn board the instant the group's cargo manifest is empty (the game's own "loading done" signal), so pawns board on their own. It still never boards before the cargo is physically in, so nothing launches early.

  Psychic rituals: a ritual target could have its inventory emptied as a ritual started, which cancelled the ritual. A previous fix stood Hauler's Dream down for pawns taking part in a ritual, but a ritual TARGET is directed differently and slipped through. Hauler's Dream now also stands its automatic inventory handling down for any pawn driven by a ritual/quest duty (not just full ritual participants), and no longer bulk-empties a pawn that is busy with a directed activity. Explicit player orders are unaffected, and normal pack-animal unloading still works.

- fb04e90: fix: settings icons missing on the Steam Workshop build.

  The mod-settings window icons (the category and feature icons under Textures/HaulersDream/Settings) showed up in a local install but not in the Steam Workshop version. The Workshop packaging script copied About, Defs, Patches, and Languages but not the Textures folder, so the published mod shipped without any of its icon art (the local deploy, which does copy Textures, hid the gap). The packaging now includes Textures, matching the local deploy. Re-publishing the Workshop item picks up the icons.

- 97d9768: fix: pawns mining/harvesting no longer run home to unload after a single block.

  When a pawn mined or harvested, scooped the yield, and the work scan then handed it a nearby non-yield job (often cleaning), Hauler's Dream diverted it all the way to storage to unload after that single item, far short of a full load. So a pawn sent to mine would run out, mine one block, run all the way back, and repeat, instead of accumulating a pack and making one trip.

  The "drop your load before unrelated work" divert now waits for the same brief settle the end-of-run unload already uses: while a pawn is still actively scooping (mid mine/harvest run), a quick non-yield detour no longer counts as the run being over, so it keeps its load and keeps working until it is full, the run genuinely winds down, or it heads off to rest or eat. Continuous same-task work and the full-inventory trip are unchanged.

## 1.10.0

### Minor Changes

- 0431ba6: feat: batch crafting that finishes on its own terms, an overshoot option, sowing route planner, and dropdown tooltips.

  Batch "Do forever" now keeps the pawn crafting an uninterrupted run instead of one item at a time, and the pawn unloads what it made and stops on its own when it would rather eat, rest, fight, or attend to something more pressing, so it never freezes onto the bench. The pawn fetches a whole batch of ingredients in one trip, makes them, and hauls the results out, then yields to its other needs.

  Batch "Do until you have X" now has an optional "overshoot by Y": once a pawn has started a batch (the game starts it while you are still below X), it keeps going up to X+Y so it finishes a useful round number while it is already there, instead of stopping the instant the count crosses X. Set Y to 0 (the default) to keep the exact vanilla behaviour of stopping at X. The "Pause when satisfied" option still ends a normal batch at X; it only steps aside inside an active overshoot window because that is what asking for Y more means.

  Added a route planner for the "sow growing area" task, the sowing companion to the existing planners. Right-click a growing zone with a colonist selected and choose "Plan prioritized sowing" to queue an ordered sweep over the zone's empty cells.

  Batch dropdown entries ("Batch: Do X", "Do until you have X", "Do forever", "Batch size", and the new overshoot option) now show a short tooltip on hover explaining what each one does.

- 5afa466: feat: batch crafting under Common Sense (on by default).

  When Common Sense is installed with its "advanced cleaning" or "haul all ingredients" features on (both default on), Hauler's Dream hands the whole cook/craft flow over to Common Sense to avoid an ingredient ping-pong loop, which meant batch-flagged bills fell back to one item at a time.

  New setting "Batch even with Common Sense active" (Mod options, under Crafting batches; only shown when Common Sense is installed, on by default) lets bills you marked for batching still batch while Common Sense keeps handling everything else. This is safe because batch crafting runs on its own separate job that Common Sense never touches, so its ingredient-hauling and cleaning can't interfere; the looping inventory-gather and ingredient-share paths stay handed over to Common Sense regardless.

  Turn the setting off to hand all cooking and crafting back to Common Sense. When it's off, batching is suppressed, so the "Batch: ..." options no longer appear in the bill's repeat-mode menu and the batch size marker is hidden, instead of offering a mode that wouldn't run.

## 1.9.2

### Patch Changes

- c687b08: Three fixes:

  - Pawns no longer drop their gathered crops, milk, or wool on the ground when they start their next job (issue #62). Hauler's Dream scoops those yields into the pawn to carry to storage, but the game's own "drop unused inventory" routine was throwing them on the floor once a colony had been running for a while (which is why it showed up on established saves but not a fresh test colony). Hauler's Dream now keeps the items it scooped until they're hauled to storage.

  - Fixed an endless back-and-forth where a pawn with a bulk stone-cutting bill (e.g. the "Bulk Stonecutting" mod) kept carrying chunks between the stonecutter and storage without ever cutting them (issue #63). Hauler's Dream no longer reroutes bills whose ingredients can't stack (stone chunks), leaving them to the game's normal one-at-a-time gathering, which builds them correctly.

  - Fixed the construction route planner leaving blueprints stuck and unbuildable until they were cancelled and re-placed (issue #64). Planning a build-order route was over-reserving materials across many blueprints, which made the game think they were already fully supplied so no one would build them. Route and player-prioritized deliveries no longer do that extra batching (automatic construction hauling still batches as before).

## 1.9.1

### Patch Changes

- fe88bd0: fix: settings window failing to close, and harden the storage search against other mods' malformed storage.

  Closing the mod settings window could throw an error and refuse to close when another work-related mod was installed (issue #59). Hauler's Dream was refreshing every colonist's work types on every settings write, which needlessly ran other mods' work-type code each time; if one of those threw, it broke the window close. Hauler's Dream now refreshes work types only when one of its "all pawns can haul / clean / cut plants" overrides actually changed, so a normal settings close no longer pokes unrelated mods.

  Hauler's Dream's storage search now skips a storage group that has no settings instead of crashing on it (issue #58). Some mods can momentarily expose storage in a half-built or partly-removed state; Hauler's Dream already guarded the chosen group this way, and now does so consistently in its storage loops, so its own code stays robust when another mod is involved.

## 1.9.0

### Minor Changes

- 351a90b: feat/fix: five player-reported improvements.

  Mechanoid carry capacity now tracks the mech's own "carrying capacity" (the value shown on the mech's UI panel) instead of a flat amount. A vanilla lifter and a modded high-capacity loader now haul amounts that match their carrying capacity rather than the same small default. The per-mech haul multiplier still applies on top, and humanlikes, animals, and Combat Extended users are unchanged.

  Fixed red errors when right-clicking eggs (or other items held inside a container building, like an egg box) with a colonist selected. Those items are not lying on the floor, so the pickup and haul-nearby orders now skip them instead of throwing.

  You can now order a pawn to pick an item straight into its inventory while DRAFTED, and the order works on forbidden items (for example, food dropped in a prison cell that got auto-forbidden). The picked item is carried until the pawn is undrafted, then put away in normal storage, unforbidden.

  Fixed pawns getting stuck in an endless "gathering ingredients" loop when crafting or cooking a recipe with many ingredients under the "Do until you have X" bill setting (for example baking pies in a large multi-ingredient oven). Such recipes now use the game's normal ingredient gathering.

  Fixed Hauler's Dream interfering with order-based recycling mods (such as Recycle This): an item you have marked for recycling is no longer scooped into a pawn's inventory before the recycling job can carry it to the workbench. Hauler's Dream now leaves items alone when another mod has claimed them with an order.

### Patch Changes

- 50a1dab: fix: under Combat Extended, mechanoids now haul according to their carrying capacity.

  With Combat Extended installed, a hauler mechanoid was limited by Combat Extended's carry weight (a flat body-size value, around 42 kg for most lifters) regardless of its carrying capacity, so a vanilla lifter (carrying capacity 52) and a modded advanced loader (158) both hauled about the same small amount, and a fuller mech crawled once it passed that tiny limit. Hauler's Dream now sets a player mechanoid's Combat Extended carry weight to its carrying capacity, so it loads up to that capacity without hitting Combat Extended's over-capacity slowdown (Combat Extended's encumbrance and fit checks now follow the carrying-capacity number). The mech-haul multiplier in the settings now also applies under Combat Extended. Pawns other than your own mechanoids, and games without Combat Extended, are unaffected.

## 1.8.1

### Patch Changes

- 45b3fc6: fix: two crash fixes.

  Fixed a startup crash ("Could not resolve type ... Multiplayer.API.SyncMethodAttribute") that prevented the game from loading when RimWorld Multiplayer was not installed. Hauler's Dream now registers its Multiplayer sync handlers by name instead of through a baked attribute, so no part of the mod's metadata references the Multiplayer API when that mod is absent. Multiplayer behaviour is unchanged when Multiplayer is installed.

  Fixed a case where a broken work giver from another mod could stall a colony's work. RimWorld runs every work giver's eligibility check inside one unguarded loop, so a single work giver that throws there aborts the pawn's entire work selection every tick (all hauling, cleaning, and so on stall). Hauler's Dream now contains such a throw: if a work giver that is not Hauler's Dream's own throws while RimWorld checks whether a pawn can use it, the error is logged once and that one work giver is skipped for that scan, so the rest of the pawn's work keeps running. Hauler's Dream's own work givers still surface their errors normally.

## 1.8.0

### Minor Changes

- 4e70022: feat: report bugs, request features, and ask for mod compatibility from inside the game. A new "Report an issue" action opens a short form where you pick the report type (bug, feature request, mod compatibility, or something else), describe what happened, and send it straight to the developer. Your active mod list, game version, OS, and Hauler's Dream's own diagnostic log are attached automatically, with an option to also include the tail of your full Player.log for trickier bugs.

  You can attach Steam screenshots straight from a picker (take one with the Steam overlay and it shows up), and a "My reports" view lets you check back on what you sent and read the developer's replies, so a report becomes a short conversation rather than a one-way message.

  Hauler's Dream now also keeps a small always-on diagnostic log in the background (independent of the verbose-logging setting) so a bug report carries the context needed to track the problem down, without you having to reproduce it with logging turned on first.

## 1.7.0

### Minor Changes

- 79afbf2: feat: full **RimWorld Multiplayer** compatibility. Hauler's Dream now works in multiplayer — every feature (smart inventories, bulk loading, route/craft planning, the per-pawn gizmos, batch sizing) runs deterministically across all clients.

  Under the hood this routes every player-initiated action that changes saved state (the auto-haul toggle, "Unload inventory", Plan Route, Plan Craft, batch-size edits, carrier unload) through Multiplayer's command-sync, and makes the autonomous hauling/sweeping/bulk-loading logic pick the same targets on every client (deterministic tiebreaks), so the simulation never diverges. Multiplayer support is a soft dependency — it adds nothing and changes nothing when the Multiplayer mod isn't installed.

  A note for multiplayer hosts: Hauler's Dream settings are host-authoritative — they sync to everyone when you join (accept Multiplayer's "Apply configs" prompt), and the settings window is locked during a multiplayer session so a mid-game change can't desync the game.

- 74d881e: Four fixes from player reports:

  **Fixed a NullReferenceException flood after migrating a save off Pick Up And Haul.** When you remove Pick Up And Haul (which Hauler's Dream replaces) and load a save where a pawn (often a Lifter mech) was mid-haul, that pawn's old job can no longer be loaded and deserializes broken. RimWorld's own cleanup of such a job crashes on it, so the broken job is never cleared and the pawn throws an error every tick. Hauler's Dream now repairs these orphaned jobs, and the reservations they leave behind, when the save loads, so the affected pawns simply pick new jobs and the errors stop. It is a one-time cleanup per save and does nothing on a clean game.

  **Mechanoids now haul in proportion to their carrying capacity, with an optional multiplier.** Hauler's Dream already sizes each pawn's haul by its carrying capacity, so a modded high-capacity lifter already carries more than a vanilla one. A new "Mechanoid carrying capacity" slider (Who can haul, default ×1.0) lets you push your work mechs further, so a dedicated lifter makes fewer, bigger trips. The mech is slowed by the extra load the same way a colonist is, so the smart-overload trade stays balanced. No effect at ×1.0, and Combat Extended keeps managing carry weight when it is installed.

  **Added a setting to show the per-pawn auto-haul toggle (Unloading, off by default).** The "Auto-haul yields" toggle on each pawn is now hidden unless you turn this on, keeping the command bar uncluttered. Pawns still auto-haul exactly as before; turn the setting on if you want to stop individual pawns from auto-hauling.

  **Fixed vehicle cargo loading being silently off when Vehicle Framework is installed.** Hauler's Dream checks for Vehicle Framework as the game loads, but that check happened slightly too early, before the game had finished setting up Vehicle Framework's stats. Because of the timing it switched the whole integration off for the rest of the session even though it is on by default, so colonists never bulk-loaded a vehicle's cargo in one trip and eating or building from a parked vehicle's cargo did not work. The check now reads the vehicle stat the first time it is actually needed during play, so the integration turns on as intended.

## 1.6.0

### Minor Changes

- e168b2b: feat: full localization + translations for 14 languages. Every piece of player-facing text now goes through RimWorld's translation system (the last few hardcoded fallback strings were externalized), and the mod ships with translations for **Chinese (Simplified), Danish, Dutch, French, German, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Polish, Portuguese (Brazilian), Russian, Spanish, Thai and Ukrainian** alongside English — settings, menus, alerts, planners, job reports, everything.

  The non-English translations are a complete first pass (AI-assisted, using RimWorld's established per-language terminology); native-speaker corrections and additional languages are very welcome via a quick pull request — see the new CONTRIBUTING translation guide. A build-time parity check (`scripts/check-translations.ts`) guarantees every language defines exactly the English key set with matching placeholders, so a translation can never silently fall out of sync.

## 1.5.0

### Minor Changes

- 0d2f6d7: Added experimental, opt-in bulk-loading from the Storage Network mod's servers. Storage Network keeps stored items virtually (despawned inside its servers), so they were invisible to the bulk-load sweep — a transporter, pod, portal or vehicle whose manifest lived in the network loaded one stack per trip instead of everything at once. With the new "Bulk-load from Storage Network (experimental)" setting enabled (off by default; the option only appears when Storage Network is installed), Hauler's Dream now adds the network's stored stacks to the load plan, pulled through a usable and reachable terminal, and lets Storage Network materialise them on demand so the whole load is gathered in one trip. The amount is still bound to the manifest, the pawn's carry capacity and the claim ledger, and any stack the network can't hand over is simply left for the normal one-stack loading — nothing is over-pulled or stranded. It is opt-in because it relies on Storage Network's own on-demand behaviour.
- 0d2f6d7: feat: new **"Migration"** settings tab — a clean-transition guide that appears only when you still have a mod Hauler's Dream replaces active (Pick Up And Haul, While You're Up, Meals on Wheels, Harvest and Haul, Auto Strip on Haul, Haul After Stripping, Everyone Hauls, Haul to Stack, Bulk Load For Transporters, Haul After Slaughter).

  Running one of those alongside Hauler's Dream makes them fight over the same hauling jobs — the usual reason pickup looks broken or flaky right after switching. The tab sits at the bottom of the settings tab list with a warning-amber icon and label, lists exactly which replaced mods you still have on, and offers two ways to fix it: a **"Disable them for me"** button that (after a confirmation warning you to save first) turns the replaced mods off and restarts the game, or the manual safe steps — draft your colonists and save, disable the mods, reload and save, then carry on.

  Detection now catches **community translations and continuations**, not just the exact original mods: each active mod is matched both by packageId and by a normalized substring of its name and packageId, so a translated "Pick Up And Haul 日本語" or a "…(Continued)" reupload is still recognized. The tab hides itself automatically once none of the replaced mods are active. No setting and no save data are added.

### Patch Changes

- 0d2f6d7: Fixed compatibility with **Everybody Gets One** (the "Everybody Gets One - Continued" mod): with Hauler's Dream enabled, the mod's custom bill repeat modes ("one per person", "X per person", "with surplus") disappeared from the repeat-mode dropdown, so you couldn't set a bill — e.g. clothing — to "one per person" at all. Hauler's Dream's batch feature rebuilds that dropdown and was fully replacing the vanilla menu, which skipped the hook Everybody Gets One uses to add its modes. Hauler's Dream now surfaces those modes (with their own labels and validity checks) alongside its batch options. It also makes its product-count correction mode-aware so an Everybody Gets One "one per person" bill correctly pauses once everyone has one instead of overproducing, and it leaves those bills' crafting to the other mod rather than batching them.
- 0d2f6d7: Broadened mod compatibility with a set of general patterns (each helps any mod with the same kind of feature, not just the named one):

  - **Item Policy**: Hauler's Dream now respects a pawn's per-pawn Item Policy inventory-stock counts, so it no longer strips items the policy wants kept (which previously fought Item Policy's re-fetch in an unload/re-fetch loop). The kept count feeds Hauler's Dream's existing count-aware keep, so the surplus above the policy amount still unloads normally. Inert without Item Policy.
  - **Foreign unload jobs**: Hauler's Dream's inventory-unload substitution now only replaces vanilla's own unload, never another mod's custom unload job (e.g. Common Sense's marked-items unload, or a carrier-unload routed through the work scan such as Bulk Load For Transporters), so those mods' unload flows are left intact.
  - **Work-selection ordering**: Hauler's Dream's two opportunistic work-scan hooks now run last, so they react to the final chosen job after a job-substituting mod (e.g. While You Are Nearby) has had its say, instead of racing it.

- 0d2f6d7: Vehicle Framework: a vehicle's cargo hold is now treated as the player's to manage. Hauler's Dream no longer sources build materials (build-from-inventory) or meals (meals-on-wheels) out of a parked, loaded vehicle's cargo, so a trip loadout you packed isn't silently undone — matching how it already declines to bulk-unload a vehicle. And when Hauler's Dream's Vehicle Framework support is turned off, it now ignores vehicles entirely, no longer depositing into a vehicle's cargo via the pack-animal loading path (at both job selection and the in-flight deposit loop). Inert without Vehicle Framework.
- 0d2f6d7: Bulk refuel: fix a crash and revive the feature for impassable refuelables (e.g. Advanced Power Plus's advanced nuclear generator). Hauler's Dream anchored its one-trip fuel sweep at the refuelable's own cell, but a generator, deep drill or reactor sits on an impassable footprint with no passable region there — which made RimWorld's fuel finder dereference a null region and throw, freezing colonists in a job-search loop and breaking the building's right-click menu. The sweep now starts from the hauler's own (always-passable) cell, exactly as vanilla's normal refueling does, so it no longer crashes and once again bulk-refuels generators and drills instead of silently falling back to one-stack-at-a-time. Fixes #34.
- 0d2f6d7: Silence the startup debug-log warnings about types holding texture/material fields without `[StaticConstructorOnStartup]`. RimWorld structurally checks every type with a static `Texture2D`/`Material` field for that attribute (so its assets are guaranteed to load on the main thread) and logs a warning when it's missing — Hauler's Dream tripped it on three: the per-pawn unload gizmo (`Patch_Pawn_GetGizmos`), the settings window's header/icon textures (`HaulersDreamSettings`), and the route-preview line material (`MapComponent_RoutePreview`). All three now carry the attribute (matching the existing `DetourOverlay` usage), so the warnings are gone; the textures still load lazily on the main thread exactly as before, so there's no behavior change.

## 1.4.1

### Patch Changes

- 432b283: Fixed bulk-loading transporters, shuttles, drop pods, portals and vehicles when the goods live in a storage building such as shelves, deep storage or ordinary stockpiles. The bulk-load sweep only ever looked at loose items lying on the ground (the haulables list excludes anything already in valid storage), so when everything was stored the sweep found nothing and the pawn fell back to the vanilla one-stack-per-trip behaviour — taking a single pack instead of everything the manifest needed. Hauler's Dream now also sweeps the stacks held in storage for the items being loaded, so the whole load is gathered in one trip as intended. The amount taken is still bound to the manifest and the pawn's carry capacity, and anything a storage keeps off-map (rather than as a normal on-map stack) is left to vanilla, so nothing is over-pulled or stranded. (This covers storage that keeps its items spawned on the map; a virtual/digital storage such as Storage Network, whose items are held despawned inside its servers, is handled separately by the opt-in setting added in a later version.)
- 432b283: Fixed colonists being left with no way to load a transporter, shuttle, drop pod or map portal once they were already assigned to board it. While a pawn was under the caravan/portal boarding lord, Hauler's Dream suppressed vanilla's "Load X" right-click option, but its own bulk-load option also intentionally stands aside there (to let the vanilla gather-and-board flow run) — so right-clicking the transporter offered nothing and the pawn could not be hand-directed to load. Hauler's Dream now keeps vanilla's load option whenever its own bulk option declines, so there is always a way to order the load.
- 432b283: Fixed a "started 10 jobs in one tick" error and pawn stall when a colonist hauled a corpse (or any other unstackable item) to a storage cell. Haul To Stack deliberately leaves the destination cell unreserved so several haulers can top up the same tile at once — but an unstackable thing can never share a cell, and removing the reservation also removed the vanilla throttle that stops the same cell from being re-picked every tick. When two haulers contended the same one-capacity corpse cell, the work scan re-issued the identical haul over and over until the engine's safety guard tripped and the pawn froze doing nothing. Unstackable items (corpses, minified buildings, weapons) now keep vanilla's cell reservation; stackable hauling is unchanged.

## 1.4.0

### Minor Changes

- fb03a04: feat: on caravan/away maps, a building you uninstall is now scooped into the worker's inventory so several uninstalled structures load onto the pack animals in one trip, instead of one cross-map back-and-forth walk per item. New "Uninstalling — minified buildings" toggle (on by default) under the per-work-type yield settings. Only fires on non-home maps and only where the item can actually be delivered; on your home colony an uninstalled building is left on the ground for normal hauling or re-installation, unchanged.

### Patch Changes

- fb03a04: fix: every message, warning, and error Hauler's Dream writes to the log now carries the `[Hauler's Dream]` tag from a **single source of truth** (so the tag can be changed in one place), and a universal breadcrumb is attached to **every method the mod patches**. If an exception passes through Hauler's Dream's code, it is now logged with the tag — identifying that the mod is in the call stack, _without_ falsely claiming the mod caused it — and then **re-thrown unchanged**. Errors are never swallowed or downgraded; the game still reports them exactly as before. The breadcrumb is logged once per method so a per-tick fault can't flood the log. The single intentional fail-open path (the redundant Vehicle Framework reservation, which is safe to skip because a separate authoritative check already stood the pawn down) also now logs a tagged once-per-session warning instead of failing silently.
- fb03a04: fix: batch-crafting now mixes ingredients correctly across repetitions. Recipes that allow mixing (every cooked meal, plus kibble/pemmican/chemfuel/beer) couldn't batch properly — the batch planner froze a single ingredient def per slot, so a meal bill used only potatoes _or_ only rat meat and refused to craft when no single ingredient alone covered a serving. The batch planner and driver are now mix-aware: each repetition's ingredient mix is chosen by value from current stock at craft time (mirroring vanilla's own mixing fill), and the batch is sized by total available nutrition. Meals and other mixing recipes batch many reps from one pre-load again, mixing exactly as a normal single craft would.
- fb03a04: fix: a "Do until you have X" bill no longer silently stops being worked while finished products sit in a colonist's inventory. Hauler's Dream counts products in flight toward storage so the colony doesn't overproduce — but it was also counting products a pawn keeps (food, drugs, loadout) that never reach storage, permanently inflating the count so the bill read "already satisfied" and was never offered to any pawn (the bench appeared dead with no error). Only the surplus actually heading to storage is now counted, so the bill resumes correctly.
- fb03a04: fix: high-capacity refuelables (e.g. a large bulk-fed cooking pot from a mod) can now be bulk-refuelled. The bulk-refuel order required the ENTIRE remaining fuel deficit to be reachable in a single sweep, which rarely holds for a big refuelable, so the order silently did nothing — the "Prioritize bulk refuelling" option no-op'd and the fill couldn't be forced. It now accepts a partial sweep, filling what it can reach now and topping up on a later trip, the same way vanilla's single-stack refuel already tolerates fuelling a little at a time. (Other refuel mods' work — turrets, Combat Extended, Vehicle Framework — is untouched, as before.)
- fb03a04: fix: builders no longer zig-zag across a wall/fence line when delivering construction materials in one inventory trip. A multi-site delivery now drives to the **nearest remaining build site from where the pawn is standing** on each hop (a greedy nearest-neighbour route), instead of following the queue's fixed distance-from-a-single-anchor order — which sent the pawn concentrically around the first-filled site in an alternating-sides pattern, turning short walks into long back-and-forth trips. Single-site deliveries are byte-identical; vanilla's own hand-carry batching is unchanged.
- fb03a04: fix: colony-wide hauling/cleanup no longer silently stalls after some saves. The pre-save cleanup interrupted a pawn's in-flight bulk-load job _during_ save serialization, which could tear the bulk-load claim ledger and leave phantom claims on reload — making the planners believe all work was already taken. The save-time interruption is removed (queued-job cleanup is kept), a load-time validator releases any orphaned claims to self-heal existing affected saves, and the work/haul/rest/eat/strip seams HD hooks now log a clear, attributed error (and still rethrow) instead of failing silently if anything throws there.
- fb03a04: fix: Hauler's Dream no longer injects its "share carried ingredients for crafting" candidates into a **mechanoid's** crafting bill, nor reroutes a mech's ingredient gather through inventory. A colony mech ignores forbidden / allowed-area when sourcing ingredients and is bounded by its work range, so an injected or rerouted candidate could feed a vanilla `DoBill` the mech can't complete — a contributor to the _"started 10 jobs in one tick"_ crafting loop (e.g. a Fabricor at a stonecutter's table). Share-for-crafting is a colonist scoop feature, and the ingredient injection was previously the only such path that ran for mechs **regardless of the "allow mechanoids" setting** — inconsistent with the gather conversions, which already respected it. All of HD's share-for-crafting machinery is now consistently mech-excluded (single source of truth). Colonist crafting is byte-identical. Note: the underlying loop is primarily vanilla mech behaviour; this removes Hauler's Dream as any possible contributor.
- fb03a04: fix: the right-click "Pick up" order is no longer offered for an item already sitting in its best storage — where the pawn would pick it up only to immediately carry it back, looking like it refused the order. Items in a worse stockpile (or no storage) can still be picked up and upgraded exactly as before.
- fb03a04: fix: pawns inside a Vehicle Framework RV (or any non-home map that has player storage) now unload scooped items into the local shelves/zones instead of looping pick-up → drop forever. The unload routing treated every non-home map as "caravan, load a pack animal", which dead-ended inside an RV that has real storage but no reachable pack animal — and a first attempt to special-case it checked for a "pocket map", which a VF RV interior is not, so the loop persisted. Routing now keys purely on whether the map has player storage; genuine storage-less caravan/raid maps still load pack animals exactly as before.
- fb03a04: fix: bulk-refuelling a building whose own cell is impassable — a deep drill, a generator, a Save Our Ship 2 engine, a mod's bulk-fed pot — no longer throws a `NullReferenceException`. Vanilla's fuel finder dereferences the _region_ of the refuelable's cell with no null check, and an impassable cell has no passable region; Hauler's Dream now detects this up front (mirroring vanilla's own region test) and cleanly defers to vanilla's single-stack refuel, which works from the pawn's position. This removes the continuous SOS2 ship-engine refuel error and the float-menu error. It is a precondition guard, not a swallow: the bulk optimization is simply skipped for such buildings (the refuel still happens), and any other fault still surfaces.
- fb03a04: fix: Hauler's Dream no longer empties a pawn's inventory out from under a ritual, ceremony, or other directed group activity. A pawn gathering offerings for a ritual (for example bioferrite for an Anomaly psychic ritual) carries them on purpose, but HD's automatic unload would haul them off to storage before the ritual ran, failing it. HD now stands down its automatic scoop / adopt / unload for any pawn currently engaged in a Lord-directed activity — rituals and ceremonies, caravan forming, parties and gatherings, quest lords (vanilla and DLC) — and resumes normally once the activity ends. Explicit player orders are unaffected.
- fb03a04: fix: colonists no longer freeze "standing" next to a transport pod (or map portal) being loaded. When the remaining manifest was something the one-trip bulk sweep couldn't pick up — pawns/corpses to board, or items that are forbidden, out of the loading radius, or too heavy — Hauler's Dream told the game "there is loading work here" but then built no job, so vanilla issued a target-less haul that ended and re-fired every tick (the "started 10 jobs in one tick" error → forced wait). The "is there work?" check now builds the actual bulk job first and only claims work when one exists, otherwise letting vanilla's own loading decide — so the answer can never disagree with what gets built, and the loop is gone.
- fb03a04: fix: bulk/batch jobs no longer send a pawn through a deadly environment for _bonus_ targets. When a colonist starts a hauling / loading / construction-supply / crafting job, Hauler's Dream adds nearby items to the same trip — but those extra targets were inheriting the "ignore danger" exemption that only the single, explicitly-clicked target is meant to get (a job becomes danger-exempt while it is player-forced, or while its right-click menu is open). The most visible symptom (Save Our Ship 2 / Odyssey): a suit-less colonist the player set to mine or deconstruct would sweep up scrap sitting in vacuum and walk into space to fetch it.

  Now every UNCLICKED extra is held to the pawn's normal danger ceiling — it will never path through vacuum, fire, or deadly temperature for a bonus pickup — while the single target you explicitly ordered still obeys your forced command exactly as before. Your drawn allowed-area zones were always respected; this closes the separate danger-avoidance gap. Existing saves self-heal (an already-queued, now-unreachable self-pickup is dropped and left for normal hauling rather than walked to). On maps with no vacuum or lethal temperatures, behaviour is unchanged.

## 1.3.1

### Patch Changes

- bcf00d4: Fixed "Do until you have X" bills ignoring **Pause when satisfied** and **Unpause at** — pawns kept crafting until the target was full and the bill never paused. Hauler's Dream banks freshly-made products in a pawn's inventory (to deliver a whole batch in one trip), but the vanilla product count that drives the pause/target/unpause decision only counts items in storage and in the hands, never in inventory. So the banked products were invisible, the bill never saw its target met, the paused state never latched, and pawns overproduced. The product count now includes the in-flight banked products colony-wide, so the bill's own pause-when-satisfied and unpause-at hysteresis work exactly as they do for ordinary one-at-a-time crafting.
- 7e46eed: Fixed pawns hand-carrying construction material to a single site while ignoring identical nearby sites they could have served from the same inventory load — e.g. right-clicking to build a wall delivered one armful to one wall and skipped six others within reach. Hauler's Dream's multi-site construction delivery relied on vanilla's nearby-needer batch, but vanilla caps that batch at one hand-load of demand (and an 8-tile radius), so it could never load the inventory for more sites than a single armful already covered. Hauler's Dream now discovers the nearby same-material construction cluster itself — scanning blueprints and frames around the site, nearest-first, up to one overloaded trip's worth — and loads the combined material in one go, then delivers to each site. This applies to both right-clicked (prioritized) and automatic construction; planned routes already loaded for the whole route and are unchanged.
- 750499b: Fixed pawns dropping scooped work-yields on the ground while they keep working — e.g. a grower scoops a harvest, then drops it on the field as it carries on sowing. The anti-stranding auto-drop was treating a Hauling work-type priority of 0 as "can never haul, so this cargo is stranded." But a pawn the player set to never haul (a dedicated grower or crafter) still scoops its yields and still delivers them through Hauler's Dream's own unload trips, which don't use the vanilla hauling job — so its cargo was never actually stranded. A Hauling priority of 0 no longer triggers the drop; only a pawn that is genuinely incapable of hauling, or a stuck mechanoid, does.

## 1.3.0

### Minor Changes

- 84c9dbf: **Full "Bulk Load for Transport" parity.** Hauler's Dream now covers the remaining behaviors from the Bulk Load for Transport mod, so it works as a complete drop-in replacement. New safety nets are on by default; the more opinionated behaviors are opt-in.

  On by default (safety / anti-loss / correctness):

  - **Save survives uninstall** — a save written while a colonist is mid-bulk-load no longer leaves a broken job reference if you later remove Hauler's Dream.
  - **Softlock auto-drop** — if swept cargo ends up stranded on a pawn that can no longer haul (work disabled, hauling priority 0, or a dormant/charging/shut-down mech), only that tagged cargo is dropped so another hauler reclaims it.
  - **In-transit cargo shows in the loading dialog** — items already on their way inside a hauler's pack are counted as accounted-for, so the dialog and vanilla don't think they still need hauling.
  - **Shuttle boarding sync** — a colonist boarding a shuttle deposits its manifest cargo into the shuttle instead of flying off with it in their backpack (manifest decrements exactly).
  - **All-pawn manifests keep the vanilla option** — when a manifest is only pawns/corpses (which bulk-load can't carry), the normal "load" option is preserved instead of a dead end.
  - A small per-frame work-availability cache trims the load-path scan cost on big colonies.

  Opt-in (off by default, in settings):

  - **Opportunistic loading** — a hauler already carrying matching cargo diverts to top off a nearby needy transporter/portal/vehicle.
  - **Hybrid pathfinding** — re-ranks the nearest load targets by real walkable distance instead of straight-line.
  - **Continuous loading** — a player-forced load chains to the next group until everything reachable is loaded.

  Plus polish: optional auto-open of the contents/gear tab on select, verbose logging gated to dev mode, and a "Reset to defaults" button in settings.

- 84c9dbf: Build From Inventory: a constructing pawn now sources build materials from carried stock — its own inventory, other colonists', and pack animals' / caravan cargo — not just loose stacks on the ground. The headline case: carry steel in a caravan and order a sandbag or wall on a raid, and it builds straight from the carried steel without you manually dropping it off a pack animal. Two toggles: Build from inventory (default ON) and an opt-in Partial build (default OFF) that lets a frame progress with whatever a single carried stack provides instead of requiring the full amount up front. Floor stacks are still preferred; the common home-map build is unchanged.
- 84c9dbf: Bulk load map portals: extends bulk loading to pit gates, cave/vault exits, and "enter map" portals, reusing the transporter loading engine (same claim-ledger, planner and sweep). Items are swept into inventory and deposited through the portal in one trip, with the manifest reaching exactly empty even though each deposited stack teleports away. Portal-side anti-conflict (no false "loading stalled" alert, no premature enter) and the vanilla single-item portal-load option replacement are included, independently gated by a new toggle (default ON). Right-click a portal for "Prioritize bulk loading". (Completes the Bulk Load for Transport replacement.)
- 84c9dbf: Bulk load transport pods & shuttles: colonists now load transporters in bulk — sweeping many item stacks into inventory and depositing them in a single trip instead of one stack per trip — and multiple haulers split one transporter group's manifest without double-hauling, coordinated by a per-save claim-ledger. The manifest decrements exactly (never over- or under-count), the loading-stalled alert no longer false-fires, shuttles won't board or launch while hauling is still in flight, and the vanilla single-item load option is replaced. Right-click "Prioritize bulk loading", or let it run as ordinary hauling. The ledger survives save/load and is cleaned up on map removal; interrupting a hauler returns its claim and its swept items to the normal unload. Toggle (default ON). (Second part of the Bulk Load for Transport replacement.)
- 84c9dbf: Bulk refuel: colonists now fill refuelables — a shuttle's chemfuel, deep drills, generators, anything refuelable — in a single trip. Instead of vanilla's one fuel stack carried in hands per walk, a hauler sweeps enough nearby fuel into its inventory, walks to the refuelable once, and deposits it all at once. It only kicks in when more than one trip's worth of fuel is needed (a single-stack refuel is left to vanilla, which already does it in one trip), and reuses vanilla's own fuel finder so it picks exactly the stacks vanilla would. Runs automatically as ordinary refuelling work, or right-click a refuelable for "Prioritize bulk refuelling". Any fuel swept over what the refuelable needs stays tracked and is put away by the normal unload, so nothing is stranded. Atomic-fuel reloads (e.g. mortar barrels) and turret/Combat Extended/Vehicle Framework refuel jobs are left to their own handling. Toggle in Bulk & Carriers (default ON).
- 84c9dbf: Bulk unload pack animals: vanilla pulls one stack to a hauler's hands per trip when unloading a pack animal; Hauler's Dream now pulls many stacks into the hauler's backpack in a single visit and then ships them to storage, so emptying a loaded caravan animal takes one walk instead of dozens. Right-click a pack animal for "Prioritize bulk unloading", or let it run as ordinary hauling work. Respects Combat Extended weight/bulk, leaves the carrier interruptible for roping/caravan-forming by default, and defers mechanoid carriers to vanilla. (First part of the Bulk Load for Transport replacement.)
- 84c9dbf: Carry-weight overhaul + a "keep working when full" option:

  - **Colonists carry more freely.** The move-speed penalty for an overloaded inventory is now a gentle _curve_ instead of a straight line — a light overload is nearly free, and the slowdown only ramps up as the load gets heavy. At the default ("Fair"), colonists now fill to ~275% of capacity before it stops paying off (up from ~200%), and they're still moving at ~65% speed there instead of crawling. The overload slider scales the whole curve: looser settings carry farther with a gentler slope, stricter settings bite sooner. (The carry ceiling is still derived from the trip-vs-speed break-even, which is distance-independent — far hauls don't change how much it's worth carrying.)
  - **New "Keep working when full" option (default off).** When enabled, a pawn doing a job that scoops yields (mining, harvesting, etc.) keeps working when its inventory fills up, instead of breaking off to unload — the overflow is left on the ground for haulers. It only makes an unload trip when it's about to travel farther than its nearest dropoff (so it regains speed before a long haul) or at downtime. Lets a miner keep mining while dedicated haulers move the output. Off by default, so existing behavior is unchanged until you enable it.

- 84c9dbf: **Smarter unload ordering: nearest destination first (on by default).** When a pawn makes its unload trip carrying several different items, it now empties the nearest storage destination fully before walking to the next, instead of going in item-category order — less zig-zagging across the base. Items with nowhere to go are never stranded (they're just visited last, exactly as before). Ported from "While You're Up"'s efficient-unloading, re-expressed on Hauler's Dream's own unload. Toggle in settings.
- 84c9dbf: **En-route pickup — grab loose items on the way to a job (opt-in, off by default).** The signature "While You're Up" mechanic, re-expressed on Hauler's Dream's inventory hauling: when a pawn sets off on any job and a loose haulable lies roughly along the path, it scoops the item into its inventory first (serviced by the normal storage-aware unload), so the stray item rides to storage on a trip the pawn was making anyway — zero extra round-trips. The detour is tightly bounded by a trip-ratio check (a faithful port of WYU's `CanHaul` cascade) with a Vanilla/Default/Pathfinding accuracy knob, and it respects the per-pawn auto-haul toggle, the carry-weight ceiling, the bleeding gate, anti-double-haul, and (when enabled) the storage-building filter. Enable it in **En-route & Routing** in settings.
- 84c9dbf: Player-feedback features:

  - **Per-pawn "Auto-haul yields" toggle.** Every eligible colonist and work-mech now has a gizmo to turn its automatic yield-scooping and bulk-haul sweeping on or off individually — so you can leave a skilled miner or grower working and let dedicated haulers move the output, without touching the global settings. Default on (unchanged behavior); forced orders ("Prioritize hauling", "Haul everything nearby", "Pick up X") still work regardless.
  - **High-capacity haulers (incl. mechs) carry a real load.** Work-mechanoids are no longer capped at exactly 100% — they now use the same smart-overload as colonists (and are slowed for it by the same overload slider), so a high-capacity hauler fills a worthwhile load before its trip instead of leaving on a single stack. (A deliberate, slider-controlled balance change; set the overload slider to "no slowdown" to carry freely, or lower for less overloading.)
  - **"Pick up X" right-click order.** Optional manual right-click on a ground item to send a pawn to grab that stack (and fit more) into its inventory and make one stockpile trip — the picked items are tracked exactly like scooped yields, so they always get put away. Default on; toggle in mod settings (independent of the bulk-haul option).
  - **Optional animal inventory hauling.** A new "Allow colony animals to scoop and haul" toggle (default off) lets Haul-trained colony animals carry multiple stacks in their inventory like colonists, instead of one item at a time.

- 84c9dbf: Haul After Slaughter: when a colonist finishes killing an animal, the fresh carcass is hauled straight to storage (a freezer or corpse stockpile) so it doesn't rot where it fell. Two independent toggles, both default ON — slaughtered (tamed) carcasses, which vanilla never hauls itself, and hunted (wild) carcasses, where the hunter promptly grabs its kill if a hunt was interrupted right after the killing blow (a clean hunt already self-hauls, so this never double-hauls). Only hauls when a reachable storage spot accepts the body; otherwise the carcass is left exactly as vanilla.
- 84c9dbf: "Haul Urgently" now bulk-hauls. Allow Tool and Keyz' Allow Utilities both build their "Haul Urgently" job as a plain vanilla single-stack haul that bypassed Hauler's Dream's bulk sweep — so urgently-marked items were carried one at a time. HD now intercepts both mods' urgent-haul work giver and runs the same bulk conversion it uses for ordinary hauls: a colonist sweeps the nearby urgently-marked (and other) items into its inventory and makes one storage trip instead of dozens. It's a soft dependency (no effect unless one of those mods is installed) and inherits all of HD's bulk-haul settings — turn HD's bulk hauling off and urgent hauls revert to vanilla one-at-a-time, exactly as before.
- 84c9dbf: **Master enable switch, tabbed settings, and routing inspector text.** Quality-of-life parity items from "While You're Up":

  - **Master enable switch (on by default, no restart).** One toggle to stop Hauler's Dream starting its automatic hauling behaviors — handy for troubleshooting whether the mod is involved in something. A pawn that already scooped goods still unloads them (nothing is ever stranded) and the "Unload inventory" button stays available; the work-incapability overrides and right-click orders have their own toggles.
  - **Tabbed settings window.** The (now sizable) settings list is organized into tabs — General, Sharing & Delivery, Bulk & Carriers, En-route & Routing, Sources & Who, Planners & Advanced — each with its own scroll. No setting was removed or renamed.
  - **Routing-aware inspector text.** A pawn diverting to grab something en route shows "… (on the way to …)" / "… (closer to …)" in its job text.
  - **Dev tools** (dev mode only): a "make colony" hauling stress test in the debug menu, and an optional colored detour-line overlay.

- 84c9dbf: Meals On Wheels: when there's no food on the map for a hungry colonist, they'll now eat acceptable food carried in another colonist's (or a pack animal's) inventory instead of trekking to a far stockpile or going hungry — fewer trips, less wasted time. One toggle (default ON). Vanilla map/own/pack-animal food is always preferred first; drafted, downed and berserk carriers are left alone, a parent's in-progress baby feeding is never interrupted, and a carried meal about to spoil is grabbed first.
- 84c9dbf: Multi-site construction delivery: automatic and shift-clicked ("Prioritize construct") builds now load materials for several nearby sites into inventory in one trip, instead of serving one site per trip — previously only the route planner did this. When a pawn delivers to a cluster of same-material build sites within 8 tiles whose combined demand exceeds one armful, it loads the whole cluster's demand at once and delivers to each site in turn, far fewer stockpile trips for a fence line, a row of sandbags, or a batch of small builds. It still finishes the site it's already working before making a load trip (no abrupt interruptions), and a single-material-per-job rule keeps deliveries clean. Default on; a new "Load several nearby sites' materials in one trip" toggle sits under "Carry materials in inventory for big single builds" in the settings (and requires it).
- 84c9dbf: Settings profiles. The settings window now has a profile selector beside a new logo header: save your current settings as a named profile, switch between profiles from the dropdown, and see at a glance whether you're on a saved profile or have unsaved changes ("Custom (unsaved)" / "<name> (profile, unsaved changes)"). The built-in **Default** profile can never be changed and doubles as "reset to defaults". Profiles are stored with your mod settings and survive restarts; resetting to Default never deletes them.

  Profiles can also be **copied and pasted as a short share code** (Copy/Paste in the dropdown). The code holds the mod version plus only the settings you've changed from that version's defaults, so it stays compact, and pasting it on another setup recreates the profile (you choose the name, pre-filled with the original). The window chrome was tidied too — the redundant bottom Close button is gone and the corner ✕ now has padding.

- 84c9dbf: Opportunistic hauling is now ON by default — en-route pickup, consumer-aware storage routing, and storage building filters all start enabled (these were off before). After updating they'll be enabled even on existing setups, so turn off any you don't want on the **Routing & storage** page. Settings labels and descriptions no longer reference other mods by name; features are described by what they do. The settings info panel is polished too: every option now shows a coloured On/Off (or current value) line above its description, the Smart-overload page draws a live move-speed-vs-carry-weight curve, and section spacing/headings were tidied so descriptions no longer clip.
- 84c9dbf: Settings window redesigned. The old tabbed window is replaced by a three-pane layout — an icon navigation list on the left, the options in the centre, and a contextual description panel on the right that updates as you hover. Settings are reorganised into ten clear categories, including a new **Features** page that puts every "incorporated mod" family (bulk hauling, pack-animal/transporter/portal/refuel/vehicle loading, build- and craft-from-inventory, the planners, While-You're-Up routing, …) on one page as on/off cards, so you can switch off any family you don't want at a glance. Multiple-choice options (pick-up handling, strip policy, route selection, …) are now inline segmented buttons instead of dropdowns, sliders show a value readout, and sub-options stay visible but greyed when their master is off. This also fixes the previous panel's scroll bug, where the taller pages clipped their bottom controls and the scrollbar couldn't reach them.
- 84c9dbf: **Bleeding pawns no longer start a haul (on by default).** A pawn that's bleeding above a small threshold won't _start_ a new scoop or bulk-haul sweep — it should get treated, not detour to tidy up. This only blocks _starting_ a haul: a pawn already carrying scooped goods still unloads them normally, and explicit Strip orders you give still scoop their gear. Ported from "While You're Up". Turn it off in settings if you prefer the old behavior.
- 84c9dbf: Spoiling-First ingredient selection: when a colonist picks ingredients for a bill, they now reach for the rottable ingredient closest to spoiling, cutting overall waste. Two independent toggles, both default ON — Butcher (the most-spoiled corpse is butchered first) and Cook (meals, pemmican and kibble use the most-perishable food first). Recipe satisfaction, the ingredient search radius, multi-slot meals (meat + veg), and non-perishable crafts (steel, cloth, chemfuel, leather) are all unaffected; frozen food is left for last.
- 84c9dbf: **Storage-building permit/deny filters (opt-in, off by default).** Ported from "While You're Up": choose which storage _buildings_ Hauler's Dream's opportunistic behaviors (en-route pickup, storage routing) may use, via a per-mod foldable rules dialog. Includes curated defaults for known storage mods and special handling for LWM's Deep Storage (kept out of opportunistic hauls because of its slower access). The filter never blocks a pawn from putting its load away (the unload path is always allow-all), so it can't strand anything. One shared filter drives every behavior. Enable it in **En-route & Routing** in settings.
- 84c9dbf: **Consumer-aware storage routing (opt-in, off by default).** Ported from "While You're Up"'s "haul before carry": before a pawn carries a resource to a build site or crafting bill, it can relocate the largest nearby stack of that material to storage _closer to the consuming job_, so future fetches are short — plus optional same-/equal-priority relocation. Four sub-toggles (supplies, ingredients, equal-priority, stockpiles). It's carefully guarded so it never double-acts with Hauler's Dream's own build-from-inventory / batch-craft / bulk systems, and it stands down rather than risk a double-haul. Enable it in **En-route & Routing** in settings.
- 84c9dbf: Full Vehicle Framework compatibility (optional, reflection-only soft dependency — inert and byte-identical when Vehicle Framework is not installed, and gated behind a master toggle that defaults on).

  - **Bulk-load vehicle cargo.** Colonists load a vehicle's designated cargo the same way they bulk-load transporters and portals — sweeping many stacks into inventory and depositing them in one trip, with idle haulers splitting a single manifest via the shared claim-ledger. It works autonomously the moment you set a vehicle's cargo (HD upgrades the framework's single-stack loader in place), and a right-click "Prioritize bulk loading" is available too. Aerial vehicles load identically. Deposits go through the framework's own event-correct path and are clamped to exactly what you ordered (stuff/quality-precise), so a mixed manifest is never over-loaded.
  - **All existing features understand vehicles.** A hungry colonist will eat from a parked vehicle's cargo, a builder will pull construction materials from one, and pack-animal loading routes into a vehicle's cargo when one is present (now event-correct). Defensive guards stop a vehicle from being mistaken for a pack animal by the bulk-unload option, and skip a colonist who is riding inside a vehicle as a food/material source.
  - **Configurable.** A master "Vehicle Framework integration" toggle plus a "Bulk-load vehicles" sub-toggle, both default on. The safety guards always apply when Vehicle Framework is present.

### Patch Changes

- 84c9dbf: Robustness pass (mostly internal): clearer diagnostics and a settings-integrity guard. Hauler's Dream now logs a one-line warning when a supported mod (Combat Extended, Vehicle Framework, Common Sense) is present but an expected member it integrates with isn't found — so partial incompatibilities show up in the log for bug reports instead of failing silently. Corpse-hauling auto-strip now follows the same race-eligibility rule as every other auto-haul (so it correctly includes Haul-trained animals when "allow animals" is enabled). A build-time check now guards the 108 settings against default-value drift across their save/reset wiring.
- 84c9dbf: Internal hardening (no behavior change): the per-tick caches Hauler's Dream clears on game load are now tracked by a self-registering registry instead of a hand-maintained list, so a future cache can't be forgotten and leak stale data across a save/load. This also closes two pre-existing gaps where the route-claim cache (cleared only indirectly) and the Common Sense compat cache (never cleared) could carry a stale value into a freshly loaded game.
- 84c9dbf: Internal hardening (no behavior change): consolidated several pieces of duplicated logic into single sources of truth so they can't drift apart in future edits — the overload capacity-gate and its movement-speed penalty now derive their pawn set from one shared rule (guarded by a test so the "extra capacity costs speed" balance can't silently break), and the various hauling-eligibility job-def sets, carrier-liveness check, and "is Hauler's Dream active on this map" gate are now defined once and reused.
- 84c9dbf: Internal hardening (no behavior change): the three bulk-loading jobs that fill transporters/shuttles, map portals, and Vehicle Framework vehicles shared a near-identical multi-phase scaffold — sweep loose stock into the backpack, carry it to the target, then deposit while conserving exact item counts. That scaffold is the most safety-critical code in the mod (a mistake means lost or duplicated player cargo), and the three copies had already begun to drift apart. It is now a single shared base class (`JobDriver_LoadInBulkBase`) with only the genuinely target-specific deposit step left per job, removing ~640 lines of duplicated logic and the drift risk. The pack-animal loader and the carrier-unload job were deliberately left separate (they predate this design and differ too much to fold in safely). Save games and in-game behavior are byte-for-byte unchanged.
- 84c9dbf: Internal hardening (no behavior change): the inventory "self-heal" that decides which carried stacks Hauler's Dream owns — the single most load-bearing piece of logic in the mod — and the vein-mining route-extension decision are now pure, unit-tested functions in the Core library instead of being tangled inside Verse runtime code. This adds 32 oracle tests pinning the historically bug-prone cases (a single scoop landing across several inventory stacks, a stack merge destroying a tag's last reference, a Simple Sidearms weapon that must never be auto-unloaded, a harvested-vs-personal medicine def overlap, and the per-tick re-heal gate) so a future edit can no longer silently regress them. The runtime behavior is byte-for-byte identical.
- 84c9dbf: Internal hardening (no behavior change): the two largest source files are split into focused `partial class` files by concern. The game component that bundled five unrelated subsystems — the bulk-load claim ledger, batch-bill config, the softlock-drop driver, the vein-reveal driver, and the idle backstop — now lives across one file per subsystem, each with its own scribe block, so editing one can no longer accidentally disturb another's save logic. The 1290-line settings class likewise moves its ~480-line GUI into a separate partial file, leaving the model and persistence on their own. Because each type remains a single compiled class with identical fields, scribe labels, and scribe order, save games and in-game behavior are byte-for-byte unchanged.
- 84c9dbf: **Mechs put down what they're carrying before charging.** A mechanoid (e.g. an Agrihand that auto-hauled its own harvest) that goes to a charger while still carrying picked-up goods now delivers them to storage first — or drops them nearby if there's nowhere to put them or it's very low on energy — so the goods don't spoil or take up its carrying capacity while it sits on the charger. Governed by the existing "Free trapped cargo from stuck pawns" setting (on by default).
- 84c9dbf: Batch crafting now respects a bill's "Do until you have X" target, "Pause when satisfied", and "Unpause at" settings. Because HD's batch driver banks freshly-made products in the crafter's inventory (to deliver a whole batch in one trip), and RimWorld's product counter can't see pawn inventory, the batch never noticed the target was reached — colonists kept crafting past it and the bill never paused. The target count now includes the in-flight products colonists are carrying toward storage, so a batch stops at the target (across the whole colony, not just the crafting pawn) and the bill pauses on delivery exactly like a normal one-at-a-time bill. Repeat-count and repeat-forever bills were unaffected and are unchanged.
- 84c9dbf: Common Sense compatibility: Hauler's Dream now detects when Common Sense's "haul ingredients" / "advanced cleaning" takes over the vanilla crafting flow and steps aside, fixing the rare infinite loop where a crafter would repeatedly pick up ingredients, walk to the bench, then unload them again. Also hardened HD so it never ships a bill's ingredients off to storage while the crafter is about to consume them — protecting against any mod that rewrites the bill flow.
- 84c9dbf: End-to-end polish for the player-feedback features:

  - **"Pick up X" now works on any item.** Previously, right-clicking an item already in its best stockpile (or with no accepting storage) showed the option but did nothing. It now reliably picks the stack into the pawn's inventory regardless of storage (matching Pick Up And Haul) — still tracked, so it gets put away later.
  - **The per-pawn "Auto-haul yields" toggle is reachable while drafted** (it's a standing preference; a drafted pawn still won't scoop), and it no longer appears on animals that can't be Haul-trained (e.g. cats).
  - **Auto-strip respects the toggle** — a pawn with auto-haul off no longer pockets stripped corpse loot.
  - **Honest setting tooltips** — the animal-hauling tooltip now states only Haul-trained animals benefit; the mechanoid tooltip names harvest/mine/deconstruct-salvage scooping and points to the inventory-delivery setting; the crafting-share tooltips note the automatic stand-down while Common Sense is active; the carry-limit tooltip clarifies the Pick Up And Haul mass parity.
  - Minor allocation cleanup in the bulk-haul work scan.

- 84c9dbf: Player-feedback fixes & polish:

  - **Microstutters fixed.** The automatic bulk-haul planner no longer runs its full "is this sweep worth it?" computation (and allocations) for every loose item a colonist considers — a cheap allocation-free pre-check rejects the common no-sweep case first, the cross-pawn claim scan is cached per tick, and scratch buffers are reused. Smooths the camera/character jitter on cluttered maps with several haulers.
  - **Bulk-sweep keeps tidy stacks.** When a pawn sweeps many loose stacks of the same thing (e.g. scattered harvested food) into its inventory, they now consolidate into one stack instead of staying as many small ones — without ever merging into the pawn's own carried/personal stock.
  - **Crafting-loop conflict (with Common Sense) fully closed.** Completes the Common Sense compatibility: the last ingredient-sharing path now also cedes to Common Sense when it owns the crafting flow, so the "gather → walk to bench → turn back → empty inventory" loop can no longer occur with both mods' default options on.
  - **"Allow mechanoids" setting now has a description** explaining it governs mech scooping/hauling (vanilla mech construction delivery is separate).
  - Clarified the carry-limit setting tooltip: the limit is a mass budget over apparel + equipment + inventory; items carried in the hands are not counted.

- 84c9dbf: Fixes for reported issues:

  - **Batched crafting now sets the ingredient on the table.** When a pawn ran a _batched_ production bill (butchering, stonecutting, cooking, drug lab, etc.) it crafted the item straight out of its inventory and never placed the corpse / chunk / ingredient on the worktable. It now carries each ingredient to the bench and sets it down before working — matching vanilla, across every batched recipe — and the placed ingredient is reserved so another colonist can't grab it mid-craft. The whole-batch single gather trip is preserved.
  - **Explicit Strip orders are honored regardless of the per-pawn "Auto-haul yields" toggle.** A pawn with that toggle off now still scoops and hauls the gear from a Strip order you give it; the toggle continues to govern only autonomous yield scooping.
  - **Clearer strip settings.** Relabeled the auto-strip controls so "never" plainly means "don't strip _while hauling_", with cross-references making it obvious that manually-ordered strips still scoop and haul their gear via the separate "Stripping — removed gear" toggle (the two were always independent; the old labels implied otherwise).

- 84c9dbf: **Fix: colonists now correctly load the mech gestator.** Previously a colonist would pick up the ingredients, walk to the gestator, fail to deposit them, and carry them back to a stockpile. Autonomous worktables (the mech gestator family) deposit ingredients into the building's own container, which Hauler's Dream's gather-into-inventory routing couldn't satisfy — so those bills are now left on vanilla's native carry-in-hands-and-deposit flow. (Surfaces in combination with mods that act at job-toil transitions, e.g. Grab Your Tool!.) Normal workbenches are unaffected. The subcore scanner was never affected by Hauler's Dream.
- 84c9dbf: Hardened against future RimWorld updates: Hauler's Dream now applies each of its game patches independently, so if a single hooked vanilla method is renamed or removed in a future RimWorld build, only that one feature is disabled (with a clear log line) instead of the whole mod failing to load. Also made the partial-build "deliver from inventory" feature resolve its one reflected field lazily so a future rename degrades to vanilla behavior rather than erroring.
- 84c9dbf: Review fixes:

  - **Mixed-quality/material bulk transporter & portal loads now credit the correct manifest entry.** When a transporter or map-portal manifest held several entries of the same item at different quality or material, a bulk deposit could decrement the wrong entry, so that load would never read as "finished". Bulk loading now resolves each deposited item to its manifest entry with the exact same matcher vanilla uses (the vehicle path already did this), and the clamp, work-gate, and decrement all share that one matcher so they can't disagree. Single-entry manifests (the common case) are unchanged.
  - Hardening (no behavior change in normal play): the per-tick availability caches are now thread-local and cleared on quickload, matching the rest of the mod's caches; the two job-takeover Harmony patches have an explicit, pinned order; and a few inaccurate code comments were corrected.

- 84c9dbf: Performance: reduced micro-stutter on busy, heavily-modded colonies.

  A repo-wide allocation/CPU audit eliminated per-tick and per-scan heap allocations and redundant recomputation on the hottest paths (the usual cause of RimWorld gen0-GC micro-jitter):

  - The movement-speed overload penalty no longer re-walks a pawn's full apparel + equipment + inventory mass every cell it moves — it's computed once per pawn per tick.
  - Removed per-frame work and a game-state side effect from the inspect pane when a loaded pawn is selected.
  - Eliminated boxed enumerators and throwaway collections from the haul/load work scans, and per-call reflection allocations in the Combat Extended / Common Sense / Vehicle Framework integrations.
  - Various smaller allocation cleanups (debug logging, spoiling-first sort, route selection).

  Also adds an allocation-assertion performance test harness (`bun run test:perf`) that keeps the pure decision logic provably allocation-free going forward.

## 1.2.0

### Minor Changes

- f3fc4f6: **New "Batch" bill mode — make a whole batch of a bill in one work session, with a single ingredient trip.**

  Crafting and cooking bills now have three extra options in the repeat-mode dropdown, next to vanilla's "Do X times / Do until X / Do forever":

  - **Batch: do X times**
  - **Batch: do until X**
  - **Batch: do forever**

  When a bill is set to batch, the colonist fetches enough ingredients for the whole batch in **one trip**, makes them all at the bench one after another, then hauls everything to storage in one go — exactly the "plan prioritized crafting" flow, but automatic and per-bill. Because each item finishes individually, an interruption (drafting, power/fuel loss) only ever loses the single in-progress item, never the whole batch. If the bill's own count is reached partway through a batch (e.g. "Batch 10, until 40" when you're already at 35), only the remaining 5 are made and any unused ingredients are carried back to storage with the products.

  **Food doesn't spoil while the colonist is working.** Raw ingredients carried for the batch are frozen for the duration of the bench work, then resume spoiling normally while walking to and from the bench — so a big cooking batch won't rot the ingredients mid-session.

  **Setting the batch size.** Pick "Batch size: N…" from the same dropdown to set a per-bill amount with a slider. A new mod setting, **"Batch new bills by default"** (off by default), makes every newly-added batchable bill start in batch mode at a configurable **default batch size**, so you don't have to set it each time.

  Applies to ordinary production bills (cooking, tailoring, simple crafting, etc.). Recipes that build an "unfinished thing" — sculpting, complex components, advanced weapons/armour — are not batched, because they already keep their progress across interruptions in vanilla.

## 1.1.4

### Patch Changes

- 55e3cac: **Fix "plan construction" pawns topping off at the stockpile after every single wall.**

  When you planned a construction route over a wall line, the pawn would pick up a big load of
  material, build **one** wall, walk all the way back to the stockpile to top off, build **one
  more** wall, and repeat — a pointless shuttle that defeated the whole point of carrying a batch.

  Two underlying causes are fixed:

  - The inventory-delivery driver decided whether to walk back to the stockpile by comparing what it
    carried against the **whole route's** remaining demand. Since a single carry can never hold an
    entire wall line, and the mass headroom reopened after each wall was filled, it tripped back to
    the stockpile after **every** deposit. It now decides based on the **immediate** frame's need:
    while the pawn still carries enough for the wall in front of it, it builds straight from
    inventory and only returns to the stockpile when it genuinely runs low — roughly one trip per
    carry-load instead of one per wall. When it does re-load, it still fills to its full smart-carry
    ceiling, so the "few trips" benefit is preserved.

  - For walls that need **more than one material** (e.g. wood **and** steel), only the first material
    was gathered for the whole route; the others were re-fetched one wall at a time. The build tether
    now carries the whole route's remaining demand for every material, so steel/components batch the
    same way wood does.

  Haul-only routes, the "haul materials to site" order, plain right-click "prioritize constructing",
  and single large deliveries (e.g. a 340-steel generator) are unchanged. No save-compat impact.

- 704fe59: **Fix a hauled weapon being kept (and never put away) when it matches a Simple Sidearms sidearm's type.**

  The previous Simple Sidearms fix kept _any_ carried weapon whose type+material matched one of a colonist's
  sidearms. So if a colonist with, say, a steel ikwa sidearm was told to "haul everything nearby" and that included
  a loose steel ikwa, it kept _both_ — the unload job found nothing to do and flickered away, leaving the hauled
  ikwa stuck in the colonist's pack.

  Now Hauler's Dream keeps exactly as many of each weapon type+material as Simple Sidearms actually wants
  (it tracks sidearms by count), and treats any extra copies as normal haulable loot:

  - A loose steel ikwa hauled while carrying a steel ikwa sidearm → the sidearm is kept, the spare is put away.
  - A loose _plasteel_ ikwa hauled while carrying a _steel_ ikwa sidearm → the steel one is kept, the plasteel
    one is put away (it matches on material, not just type).
  - The spare stays tracked, so it still gets put away later even if the colonist is interrupted or drafted
    in the meantime.

  It also now always puts away the **actual hauled (or freshly-crafted) weapon**, never the equipped one — even
  when the equipped sidearm is higher quality. Previously the auto-pickup and inventory-crafting paths could tag
  the colonist's own sidearm by weapon type, so a colonist carrying a 99%-quality steel ikwa that hauled a
  3%-quality steel ikwa could end up storing the _good_ one and keeping the _bad_ one. Now it tracks and stores
  the specific item it just picked up or made, so the equipped sidearm is always the one kept.

  **Most importantly,** it fixes the case where the matching weapon is the colonist's **equipped main weapon**
  (their primary), not a pack sidearm. Simple Sidearms records the equipped primary in its remembered-weapons
  list, but that weapon lives in the _equipment slot_, not the pack — so Hauler's Dream was counting it toward
  the keep total while never seeing it in the inventory count. The result: a hauled weapon matching your colonist's
  equipped weapon computed surplus = `inventory(1) − remembered(1) = 0` and was **never unloaded** — it sat stuck
  in the pack (or, on a "haul everything nearby", got scooped into the pack and never taken back out). Hauler's
  Dream now subtracts the equipped primary from the keep total (mirroring Simple Sidearms' own unload logic), so a
  hauled weapon matching your equipped weapon is correctly put away while the equipped weapon is untouched.

  A diagnostic line (gated behind the mod's _verbose logging_ setting) now reports the surplus math for carried
  weapons, to make any future Simple-Sidearms edge case easy to pin down from a log.

  No change when Simple Sidearms isn't installed.

- ef74084: **Fix colonists occasionally stopping work to unload their own Simple Sidearms sidearm.**

  A remembered Simple Sidearms weapon could be hauled off to storage (and immediately re-fetched by Simple
  Sidearms) when a colonist happened to be carrying loose weapons that shared a ThingDef with one of its sidearms.
  Because weapons don't stack, Hauler's Dream's "same-def" inventory bookkeeping was mistaking the pawn's own
  sidearm for hauled loot of the same type and marking it surplus.

  Now a genuine remembered sidearm (matched precisely by weapon + material) is never treated as surplus: it is
  protected both where Hauler's Dream tags carried items and in the keep check itself, so it always wins over a
  mistaken tag. Loose weapons the colonist actually picked up off the ground are still put away normally, and
  nothing changes when Simple Sidearms isn't installed.

- 64b72e5: **Fix pawns freezing in the "unloading inventory" job over Yayo's Combat 3 ammo (and harden the unload against any item it can't move).**

  A colonist returning from a caravan could get stuck standing in the "unloading inventory" state; manually
  dropping their Yayo's Combat 3 ammunition fixed it. Cause: Hauler's Dream only recognised Combat Extended
  ammo as "keep in inventory", so it treated YC3 ammo as surplus and kept trying to haul it off — fighting
  YC3 (which re-stocks the pawn's ammo), and churning the unload job.

  - **Yayo's Combat 3 ammo is now kept in inventory** (auto-detected, no setup, nothing changes if you don't
    run YC3), the same way Combat Extended ammo already was. A pawn's own ammo is never hauled to storage; HD
    only ever moves _loose_ ammo it scooped off the ground. If you actually want a pawn's ammo put away, the
    per-item "always unload" rule in mod options still overrides this.

  - **The unload job can no longer get stuck on a single item it can't move.** If something can't be taken out
    of a pawn's inventory (another mod is holding it, or the pawn's hands are momentarily full), the pawn now
    skips it and unloads the rest, instead of standing in place retrying the same item. The skipped item keeps
    its place in the queue and is retried later — and still raises the "cannot unload" alert if it's genuinely
    stuck — so nothing is silently abandoned. This also covers carried grenades (More Useful Grenade) and any
    other mod that keeps combat consumables in a pawn's inventory.

  If you have an existing save where ammo got dropped during this bug, it will be picked back up by YC3 as
  normal.

## 1.1.3

### Patch Changes

- e905a9a: **Harden the "cannot unload inventory" alert so a bug in it can never blank the game's UI.**

  The black-hole safety-net alert (`Alert_CannotUnloadInventory`) recomputes its report on the UI render
  path — RimWorld calls it when you hover or click the alert, and the vanilla alerts readout does _not_
  wrap that call in a try/catch. So if that recompute ever threw an exception, it would abort the rest of
  the frame's UI drawing before the window layer, leaving the whole HUD invisible-but-still-clickable until
  you moved off the alert. Its report code is now guarded: on any unexpected error it logs the problem
  loudly (so the bug is still reported, never silently swallowed) and falls back to its last good report,
  keeping the HUD alive.

  This is defensive hardening — no behaviour change in normal play. (Investigated alongside player reports
  of disappearing UI; the most likely causes of that symptom are an unrelated mod throwing on the UI layer
  or save corruption from swapping inventory mods mid-save, which a Player.log will pinpoint.)

## 1.1.2

### Patch Changes

- fe5369d: **Fix inventory unload loops with Simple Sidearms / Smart Medicine / Dub's Bad Hygiene, and stop pawns dropping un-haulable items at random spots.**

  - **No more unload↔pickup loops with mods that keep items in inventory.** Hauler's Dream used to treat a
    colonist's carried kit as "surplus" and ship it to storage, which mods like Simple Sidearms (remembered
    sidearms), Smart Medicine (stock-up medicine), Dub's Bad Hygiene (carried water), and Combat Extended
    (loadout ammo) would then immediately re-fetch — an endless drop-and-grab loop that could leave pawns walking
    back and forth until they collapse. Those items are now auto-detected (no extra setup, and nothing changes if
    you don't run those mods) and left in the pawn's inventory. Vanilla addiction/chemical-dependency drugs are
    kept too, matching vanilla.

  - **New "Individual Item Unload Settings" picker (mod options).** A stockpile-style categorized, foldable,
    searchable list where you set how Hauler's Dream treats specific items in a pawn's inventory — per item, choose
    **Never unload** (keep the whole stack), **Keep at most N** (carry up to N and unload the rest), or **Always
    unload** (put it away even if another mod would otherwise keep it). A rule overrides the auto-detected mod
    keeps above for that item. It's fully fallback-safe: choices for items from a mod you later remove won't break
    your save, and they're restored automatically if you reinstall the mod. (Built on the vanilla item tree
    directly, so it also no longer throws errors when opened from the main-menu mod options — the old picker used
    an in-game-only UI that spammed the log when no save was loaded.)

  - **Pawns no longer carry un-storable items to a random spot.** If a harvested/mined/deconstructed yield (or
    any swept item) has nowhere it can be stored, the pawn now leaves it on the ground where it was produced,
    instead of scooping it into inventory and later dropping it at a random home-area cell. Items are only picked
    up into inventory when there's actually somewhere to deliver them.

  - **"Unload foreign surplus" is now off by default.** Out of the box, Hauler's Dream only puts away goods it
    picked up itself — it never touches a colonist's sidearms, carried medicine/water, or traded goods. You can
    still turn this on (mod options) for the convenience of auto-hauling surplus a pawn is carrying for no reason;
    it's now safe with the supported mods. Existing saves keep whatever you had set.

  The red "Cannot unload inventory" alert still fires for anything that genuinely has nowhere to go, so nothing
  is silently stuck.

## 1.1.1

### Patch Changes

- ddded60: **Bulk hauling: the second order now takes over even after the first item is in hand, big stacks ride your inventory, and a one-click "Haul everything nearby" option.**

  - **Second nearby haul takes over the sweep immediately — even mid-carry.** With bulk hauling set to "only when a
    second item is tasked" (the default), ordering a _second_ nearby haul makes the pawn switch to the bulk sweep
    right away (loading the nearby items into its inventory for one storage trip) instead of carrying the first
    item to storage solo and coming back. This now works even when the pawn has _already picked the first stack
    into its hands_ — previously the takeover silently did nothing in that case. Works with plain or shift-queued
    prioritize orders; the first item is folded into the one trip; unrelated queued work is preserved; a third or
    fourth nearby haul folds into the same trip.

  - **Oversized stacks are carried in your inventory, not left behind.** When you order a haul of a stack bigger
    than the pawn can hold in its arms (e.g. 75 steel when it can only carry 72), it now routes the whole stack
    through the (mass-limited) inventory and delivers it in one trip, instead of hand-carrying a partial 72 and
    leaving the rest for later. The amount is clamped to the destination's real free space so nothing is stranded.

  - **New "Haul everything nearby" right-click option.** For a hauling-capable colonist, right-clicking a
    haulable now offers "Haul everything nearby" alongside the vanilla "Prioritize hauling" — a one-click bulk
    sweep, so you don't have to prioritize two hauls just to trigger it. It always starts a bulk sweep, including
    when shift-clicked to queue it (previously a shift-clicked / repeated click whose neighbors were already being
    swept could degrade into a plain single haul).

  Two new mod options (both on by default, under bulk hauling): the "Haul everything nearby" right-click option,
  and routing oversized single stacks through the inventory.

## 1.1.0

### Minor Changes

- ff25cd2: **Caravan pawns now offload onto pack animals on their own.** On a caravan or other away map there's no
  stockpile, so pawns used to just carry their scooped loot around in their own inventory — and could end up
  idle or asleep with a full pack while the red "Cannot unload inventory" alert fired. Now they offload onto a
  nearby owned pack animal at the same moments they'd unload to a stockpile at home: when their work run ends,
  before they rest / eat / relax at camp, on the periodic backstop, and immediately when over-encumbered. When
  no usable pack animal is reachable the loot still rides home in inventory as before.

  The "Offload onto pack animals (caravans)" setting (formerly "Auto-load pack animals when heavy") now governs
  all of this; it still requires automatic unloading to be on, and pawns keep accumulating their whole work run
  before making the trip (no change to that). The red alert no longer false-fires on caravans where loot is
  correctly riding home — it only flags a pawn that genuinely can't offload a reachable pack animal for hours.

- ff25cd2: **Caravan / pack-animal loading.** Two related improvements for hauling while away from your base:

  - **No more dropping loot on the ground while caravanning.** Previously, when a pawn scooped materials on a temporary map (a bandit camp, an ambush site — anywhere that isn't your base), the mod would try to "unload" them and, finding no stockpile, dump them on the ground — where they were abandoned when the caravan left. Now scooped loot simply accumulates in the pawn's inventory and travels home automatically as caravan inventory; it's never dropped on a temporary map. (At your base, unloading to storage is unchanged.)
  - **Pawns load pack animals instead of carrying everything themselves.** When a caravan pawn gets over-encumbered from scooping loot, it now automatically walks to the nearest pack animal and offloads onto it — keeping pawns mobile. And a new right-click order, **"Load nearby items onto pack animal (bulk)"**, makes one colonist sweep several nearby stacks into its inventory and load them onto a pack animal in a single trip (instead of vanilla's one-stack-at-a-time carry — which still works alongside it).
  - **Shift-clicking several "Load onto pack animal" orders now makes one trip.** Previously, queuing up multiple vanilla "Load onto pack animal" orders made the pawn carry one stack in its hands per order — a separate round-trip each. Those orders now coalesce: the pawn sweeps all the chosen items into its inventory and walks to the animal once.

  Both are on by default and have their own toggles in the mod options ("Auto-load pack animals when heavy" and "Bulk 'load onto pack animal' order"). The "work on caravans / temporary maps" setting now strictly controls whether the mod is active there at all; when it's on, the mod scoops and accumulates loot but never drops it on the ground.

- ff25cd2: **Pawns now put away surplus they're carrying — even if Hauler's Dream didn't pick it up.** Previously
  HD only unloaded items it had scooped itself; anything else a colonist ended up carrying (from a trade,
  another mod, or a manual move) was invisible to its auto-unload, so it could be hauled around forever.
  A new option, **"Also put away surplus inventory a pawn is carrying that Hauler's Dream did NOT pick up
  itself"** (on by default), makes colonists at home unload _any_ surplus they're carrying for no reason —
  not just HD-scooped loot.

  "Surplus" excludes the pawn's kept food, drugs, inventory-stock, and Combat Extended loadout (exactly the
  items vanilla keeps), and caravan-loading inventory is left alone. It's more thorough than vanilla's
  occasional auto-unload. If you use a mod that keeps items in a pawn's inventory through its _own_ system —
  e.g. **Smart Medicine** stock-up, or a sidearm mod — and you don't want those put away, turn the option off
  in the mod settings.

### Patch Changes

- ff25cd2: **Pawns now overload and accumulate, instead of tripping to storage after almost every item.** This
  restores the mod's core behaviour: a colonist deconstructing, mining, or harvesting keeps scooping the
  materials into its inventory — overloading past 100% up to the smart-overload ceiling (the Overload
  slider; ~2× capacity at the default "Fair") — and makes **one** trip when it's full, instead of
  hauling each stack to storage and walking back.

  Two over-eager triggers were the cause: pawns were unloading the instant they passed 100% capacity
  (which defeats the whole point of overloading), and again on the first momentary "no work right now"
  between items (constant in a busy colony). Now a pawn unloads only when it's genuinely **full** (at the
  overload ceiling) or **done** — i.e. it has stopped picking things up for a while (a new "accumulate
  window", ~1 in-game hour by default, adjustable in settings). It still always unloads eventually (when
  full, when its work is finished, or on the periodic sweep), so nothing is carried forever.

- ff25cd2: Hardened the "no black holes" guarantee so scooped items can never be silently lost or stranded, and the safety-net alert can't be fooled into staying quiet:

  - **Items are no longer lost when stacks merge.** When a carried stack is put back and merges into another stack of the same item (which happens with some interrupt mods), the merged-into stack is now re-tracked, instead of the item quietly losing its "needs unloading" mark and being left in the backpack forever.
  - **The "cannot unload" alert now catches pawns even when another mod keeps cancelling the unload.** Previously, a mod that interrupted and re-queued the unload job faster than the alert's grace window (e.g. an aggressive autocaster) could keep resetting the alert's timer so it never fired. The alert now times how long the _problem_ has persisted, independently of whether an unload happens to be running at that instant — so a genuinely stuck pawn always surfaces.
  - **No more phantom "Unload now" churn for personal kit.** Items a pawn legitimately keeps in its inventory (drug-policy stock, packable food, ammo/loadout under Combat Extended) stay tracked so any future surplus is never stranded — but they no longer trigger a no-op unload trip every cycle or a misleading permanent "Unload now" button.
  - The unload pass, the unload trigger, and the alert now share one definition of "what counts as surplus vs. the pawn's personal kit", so they can never disagree (which previously could cause either a nag or a missed item).

  Also added a `COMPATIBILITY.md` documenting how Hauler's Dream coexists with other mods (item-adders, unload/interrupt mods, Combat Extended), from a code-level review of a real load order.

- ff25cd2: Added a safety-net **red alert** (like vanilla "Fire!") in the bottom-right when one or more pawns are carrying scooped items they cannot put away — so inventories can never silently become "black holes". It fires when nothing on the map can store the items (no stockpile, no dumping zone, not even a reachable spot), or when a pawn has been carrying items far too long without unloading (storage unreachable, or another mod keeps cancelling the haul/unload job). One alert covers all affected pawns: hover it to point arrows at them, click to cycle the camera through them. Toggle and the "stuck for N hours" threshold are in the mod options (on by default).
- ff25cd2: **Compatibility: never strand items in a non-human pawn's inventory.** Bulk hauling (and the
  caravan pack-animal loader) now use the same "who may haul into inventory" rule as scooping and
  unloading — humanlike colonists, or colony mechs when _Allow mechanoids_ is on. Previously bulk
  hauling only excluded disallowed mechanoids, so a modded **non-mechanoid "robot/animal worker"**
  race (one that's set up to do colony hauling, e.g. the Housekeeper Cat) could have items swept into
  its inventory that the auto-unload — which never services non-human pawns — would then refuse to put
  away, leaving them stranded. Such pawns now simply keep vanilla single-stack hauling, untouched by
  Hauler's Dream. Normal colonists and mech haulers are unaffected.

  Also documented (no behavior change): verified compatible with **Allow Tool** and **Keyz' Allow
  Utilities** "Haul Urgently" (their urgent hauls are never swept by HD; HD is never mistaken for Pick
  Up And Haul; HD auto-honors Keyz' "Do Not Haul"), and with **Adaptive Storage Framework** / **Neat
  Storage** (HD composes through the same vanilla storage validators ASF extends). See COMPATIBILITY.md.

- ff25cd2: **"Load nearby items onto pack animal (bulk)" now appears for every pawn vanilla allows.** A colonist who
  is incapable of dumb-labor hauling (e.g. a doctor delivering materials to a construction site) was missing
  the bulk load option even though vanilla's own one-stack "Load onto pack animal" appeared for them. The bulk
  order is a player command — like vanilla, it no longer requires the Hauling work-tag, so any pawn that can
  physically pick things up can be ordered to load a pack animal. The same relaxation applies to coalescing
  several shift-clicked vanilla load orders into one trip.

  This only affects the **player-ordered** pack-animal paths (which deposit onto the animal, never stranding
  loot in the pawn's inventory). The automatic bulk-haul still keeps its full eligibility check.

- ff25cd2: **Fix two hauling misses around deconstruction and passing storage.**

  - **Deconstruct yields are now reliably scooped.** Materials from a deconstructed building are captured at
    the moment the game places them — wherever they land — instead of only scanning the building's footprint.
    Previously, a leaving that spilled outside the footprint (e.g. a wall hemmed in by a full storage room) or
    merged into a stack already on the ground was missed and left lying around. Now they're picked up like the
    rest of the run's yields.

  - **A loaded pawn drops its load when it finishes the run and moves on to other work near storage.** When a
    pawn stops mining/deconstructing/harvesting and picks up unrelated work (e.g. cleaning) while a stockpile is
    reasonably close, it now unloads first instead of carrying the load around. The accumulate-while-working
    behaviour is unchanged — it keeps overloading into its inventory for as long as it's still doing the
    yield-producing work, and only sheds the load once that run is over.

- ff25cd2: Fixed the mod options window losing its scrollbar so the lower settings ran off the bottom and couldn't be reached. The settings list is rendered in a scroll view, but once the content grew past the last measured height (or you toggled an option that added rows, like bulk hauling or auto-strip), the underlying list silently wrapped into a second off-screen column — which collapsed the measured height back to the viewport, removed the scrollbar, and never recovered. The list is now pinned to a single column, so the scrollbar always tracks the real content height and every setting is reachable.
- ff25cd2: Stopped hiding errors. Hauler's Dream previously wrapped most of its logic in broad `try/catch` blocks that either swallowed exceptions outright or downgraded them to one-time warnings (or verbose-only debug lines) — which meant real bugs and mod-interaction issues were silently buried instead of being reported. Every one of those has been removed: errors now surface as normal red errors in the log so problems can actually be seen and fixed.

  This changes nothing about how the mod behaves when everything is working — it only affects what happens when something goes wrong (you now find out about it). Three deliberate, non-suppressing exceptions remain: the Combat Extended bridge still cleanly detects when CE simply isn't installed (via existence checks, not a catch); a single guard around third-party WorkGivers logs a red error naming the culprit mod and skips just that one (so one broken mod can't break the route menu); and the batch-crafting safety net still restores in-flight items before re-throwing, so a mid-craft failure can never lose items. If you see a new red error after updating, that's by design — please report it.

- ff25cd2: **Pawns now tidy up while they work** — a colonist deconstructing, mining, or harvesting doesn't just
  scoop _its own_ yields into its inventory; it also picks up _other loose haulable items lying around the
  work spot_ into its pack, so the whole area is cleared in the one consolidated trip instead of being
  left for separate hauls afterwards. This is the bulk-hauling sweep (which already fires on dedicated
  haul jobs) extended to work jobs.

  The pickup is into **inventory** (never hand-carried), respects the smart-overload ceiling, and only
  takes items that genuinely need hauling and have somewhere to go — never another hauler's target and
  never stock that's already in storage. Toggle it with **"Tidy up while working — scoop nearby loose
  items too"** in the mod settings (on by default).

- ff25cd2: **Pawns now put their load away before relaxing.** When a colonist finishes its work run and heads off to
  sleep, eat, or recreate, it makes its unload trip first — instead of carrying the ore it just mined to bed
  or to the dinner table. It still accumulates the whole run into its inventory while it's actually working
  (unchanged); the unload only kicks in once it stops working and turns to downtime.

  This fixes pawns being found asleep (or eating / relaxing) with a full pack even though stockpiles were
  available. Each activity has its own toggle in the mod settings — **"Put load away before sleeping"**,
  **"…before recreation"**, **"…before eating"** (all on by default). Critically tired or starving pawns skip
  the detour and rest/eat immediately; pawns in a party, ritual, medical bed-rest, or forming a caravan are
  left alone.

- ff25cd2: Pawns now properly put away items that no stockpile accepts — the most common being rock chunks (vanilla stockpiles exclude the Chunks category by default), but also mod-added materials (e.g. bronze from deconstruction) and mod-added crops whose category isn't in a default stockpile filter. Previously these were correctly picked up but, at unload time, dumped wherever the pawn happened to be standing (a workbench, the dining room) — and with no dumping zone they'd just get re-scooped on the next work run and carried around indefinitely, while everything else unloaded fine.

  The unload now mirrors vanilla's own behaviour: if no stockpile accepts an item, the pawn carries it to a dumping zone (if you have one) or a tidy spot near the colony, instead of dropping it underfoot. As a safety net, an item that genuinely can't be placed is no longer left silently stuck in the inventory. The "drop off in passing" trip also no longer gets skipped just because an un-storable item (like a chunk) happens to be in the backpack — it now checks the items it can actually store.

  Tip: if rock chunks pile up, add a Dumping Stockpile (and allow chunks on it) so pawns have somewhere to put them.

- ff25cd2: Pawns now actually put their hauled goods away promptly, instead of carrying materials around for a whole day. Previously the only reliable automatic unload was a slow timer, and a pawn could finish a big deconstruction or harvest, stuff its inventory, then work, eat, sleep and relax all day without ever unloading. Fixes:

  - **End of work run:** when a pawn runs out of work while carrying scooped goods, it now makes its unload trip right then — before drifting off to recreation or wandering — rather than holding the load indefinitely.
  - **Before meals and recreation:** a pawn that sits down to eat or relax with a full backpack queues an unload that runs the moment it's done (its meal/break is never interrupted).
  - **When overweight:** scooping that pushes a pawn over its carrying capacity now triggers an unload at the next job boundary, instead of letting it stay overloaded until it hits the much higher "smart overload" ceiling. A pawn shouldn't lug steel around all day.
  - **Heavier loads shed sooner:** a pawn carrying half its capacity or more now diverts to drop the load off on shorter trips and tolerates a slightly bigger detour to storage.
  - **Interval backstop** lowered from 6 in-game hours to 1, so even in the rare case every other trigger is missed, a load is never carried for more than about an hour. (Existing saves that changed this setting keep their value.)
  - Fixed a desync where a pawn whose meal was momentarily in its hands would silently skip an unload check.

  The "automatically unload" setting description now lists exactly when unloading happens, and what turning it off means (manual unload only, via the per-pawn button).

## 1.0.3

### Patch Changes

- e6e547d: Planned crafting polish, from a top-to-bottom review of the feature by three independent reviewers: recipes with fixed ingredients (make medicine, the whole drug lab, mortar shells) are no longer wrongly reported as having no ingredients — they can now actually be batched; a pawn that doesn't meet a recipe's skill requirement can no longer batch it (a level-3 cook could previously batch fine meals the game forbids); batches now respect the bill's own rules the way vanilla does — the ingredient search radius, rot and hit-point filters (no more cooking rotten meat the bill disallows, and batch-butchering a dessicated corpse for nothing is gone), and "make until you have X" bills no longer overshoot their target; and the per-repetition safety net around crafting was widened so even a misbehaving third-party recipe can't lose ingredients or products mid-batch.
- e6e547d: Strip on haul polish, from two independent top-to-bottom review rounds of the feature (six reviewers total). Round one: stripped loot that lands next to an existing pile of the same item no longer pulls that whole pile into the hauler's pocket — only what was actually on the body is scooped, and pieces that drop straight into valid storage stay where they landed; the destroy and drop-and-forbid tainted-apparel policies can never touch pre-existing ground stacks; quest lodgers no longer scoop strip loot (it could leave the map with them); follow-up strips are only queued for your own pawns; and two settings labels now tell the whole truth ("leave it on the corpse" notes that butchering drops it at the bench like vanilla, and "destroy it" notes that quest items and relics are always spared). Round two: a pawn that can't haul (a noble cook fetching a corpse for a butcher bill) no longer scoops loot it could never auto-unload — the body is still stripped, but the gear stays on the ground for real haulers, instead of weighing the cook down forever; manual Strip orders on corpses now honor the tainted-apparel choices just like automatic strips (and the tainted-apparel settings stay visible whenever either feature using them is on); and the strip-loot bookkeeping for modded stackable gear is now exact in every merge case.

## 1.0.2

### Patch Changes

- 3be7d1b: Harvest and haul polish, from two independent top-to-bottom review rounds of the feature: pawns now scoop their pending drops and unload in one trip for every unload trigger (previously sometimes two); the unload respects what a pawn is supposed to keep in its inventory (drug policy doses, inventory stock like a doctor's medicine, and packed food), ending a dump-and-refetch loop when a harvest merged into personal stock; arriving caravan pawns no longer stall when their whole load is spoken for by other workers; the fog-extension of planned mining routes no longer dies at the moment it should fire; leavings from an instantly-cancelled frame can't be credited to a bystander; pawns no longer walk to drops that were forbidden in the meantime or left on another map; the yield hook is now immune to other mods nesting item placements; and under Combat Extended, every stack-merge path now keeps CE's loadout tracker in sync, so custom-loadout pawns no longer drop part of their load mid-run.
- 3be7d1b: Pick up and haul polish, from two independent top-to-bottom review rounds of the feature (six reviewers total). Round one: bulk sweeps no longer pull an item back out of storage when you order two hauls in a row (the first delivery stays delivered); a bulk hauler's end-of-sweep unload now waits behind an order you give mid-sweep instead of finishing its storage trip first; under Combat Extended, the unload keeps a pawn's own loadout reserve (ammo, sidearm stock) instead of shipping it to storage for CE to fetch right back; bulk-saturated CE pawns stop their sweep instead of visiting stacks they can't carry; and a set of robustness and performance improvements to the sweep planner (cheap checks before pathfinding, hardened plan cache, safe behavior if a future CE changes its internals). Round two: drafted pawns now stand to orders — drafting a hauler mid-sweep no longer makes it march off to storage afterwards, drafted pawns are never slowed by the overload penalty, and the unload button shows why it's unavailable instead of silently doing nothing; bulk sweeps now respect how much room the destination storage actually has for each item type instead of optimistically loading the full plan; mechanoid haulers no longer get the smart-overload capacity bonus they'd never pay the speed penalty for (all carry paths); forced sweeps planned while the game is paused use fresh numbers instead of a stale cached plan; and a sweep can no longer yank (or steal, on a forced order) a stack another pawn already reserved mid-walk — it skips it like vanilla would.

## 1.0.1

### Patch Changes

- 9af4687: Pick up and haul fixes: forbidding an item mid-haul is now respected (and the unload no longer clears your forbid flag), the default "stay surgical unless a second haul is ordered" trigger no longer counts the pawn's own automatic hauling as an order, sweeps honor the non-home-maps setting, and a stale-plan edge case after quickloading is gone.
- 9af4687: Fixed material deliveries to blueprints. Inventory deliveries for big builds and claim-from-hauler handoffs failed with red errors on the first delivery to any new blueprint (the geothermal-generator case): the load arrived but could not be deposited. Deliveries now convert the blueprint to a frame exactly like vanilla and deposit cleanly, including multi-trip loads.
- 9af4687: Fixed a "started 10 jobs in one tick" error loop in Haul to stack when haulers with different allowed areas worked the same items: a stack-destination computed for one pawn could be handed to another pawn it was invalid for. Destinations are now computed per hauler, and large colonies with many same-priority stockpiles find partial stacks more reliably (the scan starts in the right storage group instead of burning its budget elsewhere).
- 9af4687: Planned crafting now respects the bill's own settings. A fresh bill defaults to Do x1, so a planned batch of 10 gathered ingredients for all 10 but crafted only 1 and hauled the rest back. The planner now caps the batch by the bill's remaining repeat count (and tells you that's the limit), and suspended or paused bills can no longer be ordered.
- 9af4687: Full-mod audit sweep, smaller fixes: carried medicine now respects the patient's medical-care restriction; turning a work override off now takes effect immediately instead of after a reload; cancelled deconstruct orders can no longer be revived by route planning; the route must-include picker can now select filth and blueprints, and Escape exits picking mode; vein-mining routes can't extend onto another map; ordered construction routes no longer re-gather materials they already delivered, and multi-material sites keep their build step; small ordered hauls to nearby clusters keep vanilla's efficient batching; the overload slowdown is consistent across strict mode, the slider and Combat Extended; haulers no longer grab stacks a worker has reserved from a carrier's inventory; plus a batch of text and tooltip corrections.
- 9af4687: Strip fixes: the follow-up strip after stripping a living target now actually fires (it previously never ran due to a job-lifecycle quirk, which also suppressed the vanilla "stripped" tale on every strip - both restored). The tainted-apparel Destroy policy can no longer destroy quest items or relics (they are taken instead), smeltable classification now matches the smelter's real rules, and corpse stripping respects the non-home-maps setting.

## 1.0.0

Initial release. Colonists use their inventories smartly when moving items, and carry out their tasks more efficiently: fewer round-trips, less walking back and forth, more time actually working.

### Smart inventories

- **Harvest and haul**: work yields (plants, mining, deep drills, deconstruction, animals) are scooped into the worker's inventory as it works, then delivered in one storage trip at the end of the run. Realistic by default: the yield hits the floor first, then gets scooped. Per-work-type toggles.
- **Pick up and haul**: a pawn sent to haul one item sweeps everything haulable around it into its inventory and delivers the lot in one trip, planned the moment the haul starts. Two modes: every haul sweeps, or (default) manual orders stay surgical unless a second nearby haul is ordered.
- **Strip on haul**: corpse hauls strip the body first: gear into the hauler's inventory, body into its hands, one trip moves both. Configurable per haul type, colonist corpses left alone by default, and tainted apparel policies (take, leave on corpse, forbid, destroy; smeltable and non-smeltable separately). Strip orders on living targets haul the removed gear the same way, with a follow-up strip queued in case the target redresses.
- **Fewer round-trips**: builders and cooks gather everything the job needs into their inventory in one sweep and walk to the bench or site once.
- **Shared inventories**: a pawn carrying goods works like a walking stockpile: workers take what they need straight from the carrier, an idle carrier walks out to meet them halfway, and everyone uses their own carried stock first. Optional: builders may claim materials from a hauler mid-transit.

### Smarter hauling

- **Haul to stack**: haulers top up existing stacks instead of starting new ones, and several pawns can deliver to the same tile at once (destination tiles are no longer reserved). Works on the ground, on shelves, and in modded storage units.
- **Drop off in passing**: a pawn heading off on a long trip with a full backpack drops its load at a stockpile that is roughly on the way.
- **Overloaded**: pawns can carry past their max carry weight, slowed while encumbered, and only when it saves time over another round-trip (break-even math). One slider from "no slowdown" to "never overload". With Combat Extended loaded, CE's weight, bulk and encumbrance rules take over entirely.

### Planning tools (right-click "Plan prioritized [task]...")

- **Planned crafting**: batch a bill with one consolidated ingredient trip; the repeat count is capped by what is actually on the map, and products ride back with everything else.
- **Route planning**: travel-optimal routes over whole patches, veins, rooms or growing zones, previewed live on the map with a time estimate. Selection modes per work kind, smart routing that ends the trip near storage, must-include picks, pinned start and end, per-target-type remembered settings, and mining routes that extend as fog is revealed.
- **Smarter construction**: ordered builds haul materials (in inventory, fewer trips) and build as one job; plan whole fence lines as haul-only or haul and build; a separate order stocks a site before it is even buildable.

### Quality of life

- **Capable of dumb labor**: planners respect work incapability, plus three optional overrides (off by default) that let every pawn haul, clean, or cut plants, in this mod and in vanilla work assignment alike.
- Extensive mod settings: every feature has a working enable or disable, plus fine-tuning sliders.

### Compatibility

- Requires Harmony. Safe to add to existing saves.
- Compatible with Combat Extended and Adaptive Storage Framework (storage mods work by construction: every haul destination is validated through the game's own storage check).
- Replaces: Pick-up and Haul, Harvest and Haul, Auto Strip on Haul, Haul After Stripping, Everyone Hauls, Haul to Stack.
